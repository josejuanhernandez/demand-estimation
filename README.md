Abstract: We develop and demonstrate models that combine engineering and statistical approaches to estimating customer-specific end-use load curves. Simulated end-use loads from engineering methods enter as explanatory variables in statistical models, and estimated parameters adjust the engineering loads on the basis of customers' observed loads. The resulting end-use loads, called statistically adjusted engineering (SAE) loads, depend on a variety of conditioning variables, including weather and the size and type of the customer's dwelling (which enter the engineering simulations) and the income and other characteristics of the household (which enter the statistical adjustment). Using data from a Los Angeles sample of households, several SAE models are estimated that differ in the flexibility that they allow in the adjustment of the engineering loads.

Abstract: DELMOD is a domestic end-use forecasting and simulation model for the residential electricity load curve in New South Wales, Australia. For a given scenario it produces profiles for average working and non-working days for a given month. With its detailed representation of the appliance stock and socio-demographic characteristics, and its facilities for investigating conservation effects and weather sensitivity, it is an extremely flexible tool for examining a great variety of future scenarios. The paper outlines the structure of DELMOD, discusses the estimation procedures employed, and presents a range of scenario forecasts produced by the model.

Abstract: In order to improve the operation of district-heating systems, it is necessary for the energy companies to have reliable optimization routines, both computerized and manual, implemented in their organizations. However, before a production plan for the heat-producing units can be constructed, a prediction of the heat demand first needs to be determined. The outdoor temperature, together with the social behaviour of the consumers, have the greatest influence on the demand. This is also the core of the load prediction model developed in this paper. Several methodologies have been proposed for heat-load forecasting, but due to lack in measured data and due to the uncertainties that are present in the weather forecasts, many of them will fail in practice. In such situations, a more simple model may give as good predictions as an advanced one. This is also the experience from the applications analyzed in this paper.

Abstract: The paper illustrates a combined approach based on unsupervised and supervised neural networks for the electric energy demand forecasting of a suburban area with a prediction time of 24 h. A preventive classification of the historical load data is performed during the unsupervised stage by means of a Kohonen's self organizing map (SOM). The actual forecast is obtained using a two layered feed forward neural network, trained with the back propagation with momentum learning algorithm. In order to investigate the influence of climate variability on the electricity consumption, the neural network is trained using weather data (temperature, relative humidity, global solar radiation) along with historical load data available for a part of the electric grid of the town of Palermo (Italy) from 2001 to 2003. The model validation is performed by comparing model predictions with load data that were not used for the network's training. The results obtained bear out the suitability of the adopted methodology for the short term load forecasting (STLF) problem also at so small a spatial scale as the suburban one.

Abstract: There are varieties of physical and behavioral factors to determine energy demand load profile. The attainment of the optimum mix of measures and renewable energy system deployment requires a simple method suitable for using at the early design stage. A simple method of formulating load profile (SMLP) for UK domestic buildings has been presented in this paper. Domestic space heating load profile for different types of houses have been produced using thermal dynamic model which has been developed using thermal resistant network method. The daily breakdown energy demand load profile of appliance, domestic hot water and space heating can be predicted using this method. The method can produce daily load profile from individual house to urban community. It is suitable to be used at Renewable energy system strategic design stage.

Abstract: As well as the technical design criteria, the performance of a stand-alone photovoltaic (PV) system depends on other variables, such as the solar radiation distribution and load profile. Different load profiles are encountered in stand-alone PV applications. Load profiles may vary from 24-h constant to only nighttime or oppositely only daytime load profiles. This article presents results of system performance simulations for analysing the effect of different load profiles on the system performance. The load demand used in this article is appropriate for an average residential application with an average 9.4kWh of daily energy demand. The loss-of-load probability (LLP) of the PV system is simulated for five different weekly load profiles and the results are examined based on techno-economic parameters, including the total system cost or alternatively the cost of electricity per kWh for a 20-year system lifetime. The results are drawn based on 1-year long hourly time-series solar radiation and ambient temperature data.

Abstract: Energy planning for mixed energy distribution systems is important to increase the flexibility in the regional and national energy systems. Expected maximum loads, load profiles and yearly energy demands, all divided into heat and electricity purposes, are important input parameters to plan for the most economical, technical and environmental optimal energy distribution system for a planning area. First, this article presents a load prediction method which estimates heat and electricity load profiles for various building categories. The method is based on statistical analyses of hourly simultaneous measured district heat and electricity consumption in several buildings, as well as background information of the measured buildings. The heat load model is based on regression analyses, whereas the electricity load model is based on various statistical distributions. Second, a method for load aggregation based on the building categories’ load profiles is presented to estimate the maximum load demands, yearly load profiles, load duration profiles and yearly energy demands, all divided into heat and electricity purposes, for a planning area.

Abstract: The patterns of electricity consumption were studied for 27 representative dwellings in Northern Ireland. The type of dwelling, its location, ownership and size, household appliances, attributes of the occupants including number of occupants, income, age and occupancy patterns have differing but significant impacts on electricity consumption. A clear correlation was found between average annual electricity consumption and floor area. The monthly consumption of detached houses is between 3.57 and 5.17kWhm−2; semi-detached between 3.44 and 4.59kWhm−2 and terraced houses between 2.5 and 3.9kWhm−2. The average winter consumption exceeded the average summer consumption by 1.59kWhm−2 for detached, by 1.16kWhm−2 for semi-detached and by 1.78kWhm−2 for terraced houses. The difference in the annual demand on the grid between detached and terraced houses is between 24 and 30%. The electricity consumption per person decreases as the number of occupants increases. This is particularly significant in large dwellings but smaller numbers of occupants.

Abstract: There is a growing interest in reducing energy consumption and the associated greenhouse gas emissions in every sector of the economy. The residential sector is a substantial consumer of energy in every country, and therefore a focus for energy consumption efforts. Since the energy consumption characteristics of the residential sector are complex and inter-related, comprehensive models are needed to assess the technoeconomic impacts of adopting energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies suitable for residential applications. The aim of this paper is to provide an up-to-date review of the various modeling techniques used for modeling residential sector energy consumption. Two distinct approaches are identified: top-down and bottom-up. The top-down approach treats the residential sector as an energy sink and is not concerned with individual end-uses. It utilizes historic aggregate energy values and regresses the energy consumption of the housing stock as a function of top-level variables such as macroeconomic indicators (e.g. gross domestic product, unemployment, and inflation), energy price, and general climate. The bottom-up approach extrapolates the estimated energy consumption of a representative set of individual houses to regional and national levels, and consists of two distinct methodologies: the statistical method and the engineering method. Each technique relies on different levels of input information, different calculation or simulation techniques, and provides results with different applicability. A critical review of each technique, focusing on the strengths, shortcomings and purposes, is provided along with a review of models reported in the literature.

Abstract: Time-use data, describing in detail the everyday life of household members as high-resolved activity sequences, have a largely unrealized potential of contributing to domestic energy demand modelling. A model for computation of daily electricity and hot-water demand profiles from time-use data was developed, using simple conversion schemes, mean appliance and water-tap data and general daylight availability distributions. Validation against detailed, end-use specific electricity measurements in a small sample of households reveals that the model for household electricity reproduces hourly load patterns with preservation of important qualitative features. The output from the model, when applied to a large data set of time use in Sweden, also shows correspondence to aggregate profiles for both household electricity and hot water from recent Swedish measurement surveys. Deviations on individual household level are predominantly due to occasionally ill-reported time-use data and on aggregate population level due to slightly non-representative samples. Future uses and developments are identified and it is suggested that modelling energy use from time-use data could be an alternative, or a complement, to energy demand measurements in households.

Abstract: A pre-feasibility of wind-PV-battery hybrid system has been performed for a small community in the east-southern part of Bangladesh. Solar radiation resources have been assessed from other meteorological parameters like sunshine duration and cloud cover as measured radiation data were not available at the site. The predicted monthly averaged daily global radiation over Chittagong is 4.36 kWh/m2/day. Measured wind speed at the site varies from 3 m/s to 5 m/s. For few months and hours the speed is below the cut in speeds of the available turbines in market. The hybrid system analysis has showed that for a small community consuming 53,317 kWh/year the cost energy is 0.47USD/kWh with 10% annual capacity of shortage and produces 89,151 kWh/year in which 53% electricity comes from wind and the remaining from solar energy. The sensitivity analysis showed that the hybrid system for the community is compatible with the 8 km–12 km grid extension depending on small variation of solar radiation and wind speed over the district whereas the proposed site is more away from the upper limit. Such a hybrid system will reduce about 25 tCO2/yr green house gases (GHG) emission in the local atmosphere.

Abstract: The pattern of electricity use in an individual domestic dwelling is highly dependent upon the activities of the occupants and their associated use of electrical appliances. This paper presents a high-resolution model of domestic electricity use that is based upon a combination of patterns of active occupancy (i.e. when people are at home and awake), and daily activity profiles that characterise how people spend their time performing certain activities. One-min resolution synthetic electricity demand data is created through the simulation of appliance use; the model covers all major appliances commonly found in the domestic environment. In order to validate the model, electricity demand was recorded over the period of a year within 22 dwellings in the East Midlands, UK. A thorough quantitative comparison is made between the synthetic and measured data sets, showing them to have similar statistical characteristics. A freely downloadable example of the model is made available and may be configured to the particular requirements of users or incorporated into other models.

Abstract: An Integrated Renewable Energy Optimization Model (IREOM) model has been developed for sizing and optimization of renewable energy systems based on seasonal variation in the load profiles of the study area. An attempt has been made to develop correlations between renewable energy system sizes and their capital cost for the user specified system sizes. The developed correlations were used for the analysis of IREOM model using user specified system sizes and compared with manufacturer specified system sizes. The cluster of seven unelectrified villages having micro-hydro power, biomass, wind and solar energy resources in the state of Uttarakhand, India has been considered for the implementation of IREOM model. Based on the results obtained from the proposed model, suitable sizes of renewable energy systems have been suggested.

Abstract: Within the next years, consumer households will be increasingly equipped with smart metering and intelligent appliances. These technologies are the basis for households to better monitor electricity consumption and to actively control loads in private homes. Demand side management (DSM) can be adopted to private households. We present a simulation model that generates household load profiles under flat tariffs and simulates changes in these profiles when households are equipped with smart appliances and face time-based electricity prices. We investigate the impact of smart appliances and variable prices on electricity bills of a household. We show that for households the savings from equipping them with smart appliances are moderate compared to the required investment. This finding is quite robust with respect to variation of tariff price spreads and to different types of appliance utilization patterns. Finally, our results indicate that electric utilities may face new demand peaks when day-ahead hourly prices are applied. However, a considerable amount of residential load is available for shifting, which is interesting for the utilities to balance demand and supply.

Abstract: The Binalood region in Iran enjoys an average wind speed of 6.82m/s at 40m elevation and an average daily solar radiation of 4.79kWh/m2/day. Within this perspective, a remote rural village in Binalood region, called Sheikh Abolhassan, can readily be expected to have more than enough potential for its load demand to be supplied with a stand-alone hybrid renewable energy system. Yet the local state-run electrical service provider extended the utility grid to the village in 2006 to boost the already present diesel generator. This study aims, firstly, to explore how economical it would have been to keep supplying the electricity of the village by the diesel generator and add renewable energy generators to increase the renewable fraction of the system. On a second stage, we tried to investigate how renewable energy sources (RESs) can still be added to the current utility grid power supply in Sheikh Abolhassan to achieve a more economical and environmentally friendly system. The software HOMER is used in this study to evaluate the feasibility of various hybrid diesel-RES and grid-RES energy systems. Findings indicated that the addition of renewable power generators to the system both before and after the grid extension could and still can result in a more economical power system, which is obviously cleaner and more climate-benign.

Abstract: Due to the growth of electric end-uses, the management of the variations in time of the electric power demand has become essential, especially in the residential sector. According to this issue, the anticipation of the power demand is of great interest. This implies a better knowledge of the electric load curve of the household stock. Papers about understanding and forecasting energy demand are numerous but studies on building's load curves are rare. In this paper we propose a cross analysis of some existing methods capable of building up a residential electric load curve. Two main types of load curve models have been identified in the literature: top-down and bottom-up methods. Even if the review presents two existing top-down approaches, the authors focused the further analysis on bottom-up models. For each of them we first identify its functional characteristics: finality and scope, input data required, output format, modeled appliances and end-uses covered, generation of the diversity and validation of the model. Secondly, we establish a bloc diagram representing its architecture with focus on the mathematical model chosen. Finally, the authors list the limits of the model in view of the criteria needed to build up an ideal, bottom-up and technically explicit load curve model for the residential sector. A cross reading of the different methodologies is proposed through a global table that characterizes and sums up the analyzed models. Moreover, a graphical representation of the models studied is proposed, according to three criteria (range of application, modelling of the diversity, time scale accuracy) that allows us to compare them “at a glance”. To conclude, an identification of the gaps among existing models is proposed. It consists of listing the end-uses, the appliances and other behavioural correlations which may affect the load curve and that are not included in the reviewed methodologies and need further research.

Abstract: This paper examines the influence of dwelling and occupant characteristics on domestic electricity consumption patterns by analysing data obtained from a smart metering survey of a representative cross section of approximately 4200 domestic Irish dwellings. A multiple linear regression model was applied to four parameters: total electricity consumption, maximum demand, load factor and time of use (ToU) of maximum electricity demand for a number of different dwelling and occupant socio-economic variables. In particular, dwelling type, number of bedrooms, head of household (HoH) age, household composition, social class, water heating and cooking type all had a significant influence over total domestic electricity consumption. Maximum electricity demand was significantly influenced by household composition as well as water heating and cooking type. A strong relationship also existed between maximum demand and most household appliances but, in particular, tumble dryers, dishwashers and electric cookers had the greatest influence over this parameter. Time of use (ToU) for maximum electricity demand was found to be strongly influenced by occupant characteristics, HoH age and household composition. Younger head of households were more inclined to use electricity later in the evening than older occupants. The appliance that showed the greatest potential for shifting demand away from peak time use was the dishwasher.

Abstract: We developed a physics based bottom-up model to estimate annual housing stock energy consumption at a local community level (Census Collection District—CCD) with an hourly resolution. Total energy consumption, including space heating and cooling, water heating, lighting and other household appliances, was simulated by considering building construction and materials, equipment and appliances, local climates and occupancy patterns. The model was used to analyse energy use by private dwellings in more than five thousand CCDs in the state of New South Wales (NSW), Australia. The predicted results focus on electricity consumption (natural gas and other fuel sources were excluded as the data are not available) and track the actual electricity consumption at CCD level with an error of 9.2% when summed to state level. For NSW and Victoria 2006, the predicted state electricity consumption is close to the published model (within 6%) and statistical data (within 10%). A key feature of the model is that it can be used to predict hourly electricity consumption and peak demand at fine geographic scales, which is important for grid planning and designing local energy efficiency or demand response strategies.

Abstract: Electricity is an important asset that influences not only the economy, but political or social security of a country. Reliable and accurate planning and prediction of electricity demand for a country are therefore vital. In this paper, electricity demand in Ontario province of Canada from the year 1976–2005 is modeled by using an (adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system) ANFIS. A neuro fuzzy structure can be defined as an ANN (artificial neural network) which is trained by experimental data to find the parameters of (fuzzy inference system) FIS. Inputs for the model include number of employment, (gross domestic product) GDP, population, dwelling count and two meteorological parameters related to annual weather temperature. The data were collected and screened using statistical methods. Then, based on the data, a neuro-fuzzy model for the electricity demand is built. It was found that electricity demand is most sensitive to employment.

Abstract: According to the records of Hong Kong rail operator, MTR Corporation, the weekly electrical consumption of each railway station ranges from 18MWh to 230MWh. Since the electrical consumption of stations is a major factor in the planning of infrastructure, a good prediction of the electrical consumption will greatly assist in the design of the station infrastructure. This study develops an intelligent approach to predict the energy consumption of railway stations. Multi-layered Perceptron (MLP) is adopted to mimic the non-linear correlation between energy consumption, the spatial design of the station, meteorological factors and also the usage of the 19 stations selected. Coefficient of correlation is obtained between the MLP predicted results and the actual collected data to evaluate the performance of the prediction. We apply statistical approach to assess the performance of the developed MLP model. It shows that minimum coefficient of correlation is 0.96 with a 95% confidence level which is considered sufficient for engineering application. This approach is also adopted to predict the profile of the weekly electrical consumption of a selected station. The predicted profile reasonably agrees with that of the actual consumption. This study develops a useful tool to estimate the electrical power consumption of new MTR stations.

Abstract: This paper presents a methodology to size and to optimize a stand-alone hybrid PV/Wind/Diesel/Battery bank minimizing the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCE) and the CO2 emission using a Multi-Objectives Genetic Algorithm approach. The main objective of this work is to study the influence of the load profile variation on the optimal configuration. The methodology developed was applied using solar radiation, temperature and wind speed collected on the site of Gandon located in the northwestern coast of Senegal. Results show that, for the all load profiles, as the LCE increases the CO2 emission decreases. For the all solutions, the LCE was lower for the load profile 3 than for the load profiles 1 and 2.

Abstract: Future smart energy grids will require more information exchange between interfaces in the energy system. One interface where dearth of information exists is in district heating substations, being the interfaces between the distribution network and the customer building heating systems. Previously, manual meter readings were collected once or a few times a year. Today, automatic meter readings are available resulting in low cost hourly meter reading data. In a district heating system, errors and deviations in customer substations propagates through the network to the heat supply plants. In order to reduce future customer and heat supplier costs, a demand appears for smart functions identifying errors and deviations in the substations. Hereby, also a research demand appears for defining normal and abnormal heat load patterns in customer substations. The main purpose with this article is to perform an introductory analysis of several high resolution measurements in order to provide valuable information about substations for creating future applications in smart heat grids. One year of hourly heat meter readings from 141 substations in two district heating networks were analysed. The connected customer buildings were classified into five different customer categories and four typical heat load patterns were identified. Two descriptive parameters, annual relative daily variation and annual relative seasonal variation, were defined from each 1year sequence for identifying normal and abnormal heat load patterns. The three major conclusions are associated both with the method used and the objects analysed. First, normal heat load patterns vary with applied control strategy, season, and customer category. Second, it is possible to identify obvious outliers compared to normal heat loads with the two descriptive parameters used in this initial analysis. Third, the developed method can probably be enhanced by redefining the customer categories by their indoor activities.

Abstract: This paper presents a model to simulate the electricity demand of a single household consisting of multiple individuals. The total consumption is divided into four main categories, namely cold appliances, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning, lighting, and energy consumed by household members’ activities. The first three components are modeled using engineering physically-based models, while the activity patterns of individuals are modeled using a heterogeneous Markov chain. Using data collected by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, a case study for an average American household is developed. The data are used to conduct an in-sample validation of the modeled activities and a rigorous statistical validation of the predicted electricity demand against metered data is provided. The results show highly realistic patterns that capture annual and diurnal variations, load fluctuations, and diversity between household configuration, location, and size.

Abstract: A major issue in modelling the electrical load of residential building is reproducing the variability between dwellings due to the stochastic use of different electrical equipment. In that sense and with the objective to reproduce this variability, a stochastic model to obtain load profiles of household electricity is developed. The model is based on a probabilistic approach and is developed using data from the Mediterranean region of Spain. A detailed validation of the model has been done, analysing and comparing the results with Spanish and European data. The results of the validation show that the model is able to reproduce the most important features of the residential electrical consumption, especially the particularities of the Mediterranean countries. The final part of the paper is focused on the potential applications of the models, and some examples are proposed. The model is useful to simulate a cluster of buildings or individual households. The model allows obtaining synthetic profiles representing the most important characteristics of the mean dwelling, by means of a stochastic approach. The inputs of the proposed model are adapted to energy labelling information of the electric devices. An example case is presented considering a dwelling with high performance equipment.

Abstract: Load forecasting is critical for planning and optimizing operations for large energy systems on a dynamic basis. As system complexity increases, the task of developing accurate forecasting models from first principles becomes increasingly impractical. However, for large campuses with many buildings, the large sample size has a smoothing effect on the data so that aggregate trends can be predicted using empirical modeling techniques. The distinguishing features of this work are the large scale of the energy system (a college campus with approximately 70,000 students and employees) and the simultaneous forecasting of heating, cooling, and electrical loads. This work evaluates several different models and discusses each model's ability to accurately forecast hourly loads for a district energy system up to 24 h in advance using weather and time variables (month, hour, and day) as inputs. A NARX (Nonlinear Autoregressive Model with Exogenous Inputs) shows the best fit to data. This time series model uses a neural network with recursion so that measured loads can be used as a reference point for future load predictions. 95% confidence limits are used to quantify the uncertainty of the predictions and the model is validated with measured data and shown to be accurate for a 24 h prediction.

Abstract: This paper deals with the recent evolution of microgrids being used around the world in real life applications as well as laboratory application for research. This study is intended to introduce the subject by reviewing the components level, structure and types of microgrid applications installed as a plant or modeled as a simulation environment. The paper also presents a survey regarding published papers on why the microgrid is required, and what the components and control systems are which constitute the actual microgrid studies. It leads the researcher to see the microgrid in terms of the actual bigger picture of today and creates a new outlook about the potential developments. Additionally, comparison of microgrids in various regions based on several parameters allows researchers to define the required criteria and features of a special microgrid that is chosen for a particular scenario. The authors of this paper also tabulated all the necessary information about microgrids, and proposed a standard microgrid for better power quality and optimizing energy generation. Consequently, it is focused on inadequate knowledge and technology gaps in the power system field with regards to the future, and it is this which has been illustrated for the reader. The existing microgrid testbeds all around the world have been studied and analyzed and several of them are explained as an example in this study. Later, those investigated distribution systems are classified based on region (North America, Europe and Asia) and, as presented in literature, a significant amount of deviation has been found. Several tabulated data sheets have been used to compare and contrast the existing test systems. This research has been concluded with worthy findings and potential areas of research that would enhance the current distributed network as well as introduce microgrid testbeds comprehensively, and aid designers in optimizing green distributed system efficiency for a reliable power supply.

Abstract: In this work we present a detailed description of a 7.2kWp photovoltaic power plant installed in the remote rural village Elkaria (province of Essaouira in Morocco). This plant supplies 16 households with electricity through a local grid that was installed for this purpose. The results of monitoring some performance parameters of the plant such as load curve, the yields and the performance ratio are presented and discussed. The performance ratio of the PV plant varied between 33% and 70.2%. The low values of this parameter are mainly attributed to the way the battery inverter manages the energy flow.

Abstract: Building energy prediction is a key factor to assess the energy performance of commercial buildings, identify operation issues and propose better operating strategies based on the forecast information. Different models have been used to forecast energy demand in buildings, including whole building energy simulation, regression analysis, and black-box models (e.g., artificial neural networks). This paper presents a different approach to predict the energy demand of commercial buildings using case-based reasoning (CBR). The proposed approach is evaluated using monitored data in a real office building located in Varennes, Québec. The energy demand is predicted at every hour for the following 3h using weather forecasts. The results show that during occupancy, 7:00–18:00, the coefficient of variance of the root-mean-square-error (CV-RMSE) is below 13.2%, the normalized mean bias error (NMBE) is below 5.8% and the root-mean-square-error (RMSE) is below 14kW. When the statistical criteria are calculated for all hours of the day, the CV-RMSE is 12.1%, the NMBE is 1.0% and the RMSE is 11kW. The case study demonstrates that CBR can be used for energy demand prediction and could be implemented in building operation systems.

Abstract: Renewable energy-based off-grid or decentralised electricity supply has traditionally considered a single technology-based limited level of supply to meet the basic needs, without considering reliable energy provision to rural consumers. The purpose of this paper is to propose the best hybrid technology combination for electricity generation from a mix of renewable energy resources to satisfy the electrical needs in a reliable manner of an off-grid remote village, Palari in the state of Chhattisgarh, India. Four renewable resources, namely, small-scale hydropower, solar photovoltaic systems, wind turbines and bio-diesel generators are considered. The paper estimates the residential, institutional, commercial, agricultural and small-scale industrial demand in the pre-HOMER analysis. Using HOMER, the paper identifies the optimal off-grid option and compares this with conventional grid extension. The solution obtained shows that a hybrid combination of renewable energy generators at an off-grid location can be a cost-effective alternative to grid extension and it is sustainable, techno-economically viable and environmentally sound. The paper also presents a post-HOMER analysis and discusses issues that are likely to affect/influence the realisation of the optimal solution.

Abstract: The potential for small self-contained grid systems to provide electricity for currently unserved regions of the developing world is widely recognised. However planning and managing the electrical demand that will be supported, so that a mini-grid system is not overloaded and its available resource is used as fully as possible, is actually more difficult than for a large scale grid system. This paper discusses the mathematical reasons why this is the case, and describes a practical software tool for mini-grid demand estimation and planning that is complementary to the widely used HOMER software. This software tool is made available for download on an open source basis. Finally a conclusion is offered that mini-grid systems should aim to serve at least 50 households so that demand variability is more manageable and economies of scale can be realised.

Abstract: Approximately 27% of the European energy consumption is caused by the domestic sector, where 19% of the end use energy demand is caused by electric devices. To investigate the factors at play, a stochastic bottom-up model for the generation of electric load profiles is introduced in this paper. The model is designed for investigating the effects of occupant behaviour, appliance stock and efficiency on the electric load profile of an individual household. For each activity of a person in the household, an electric appliance is used, and its electricity consumption is linked to measured electric load traces with a time resolution of 10s. Probability distributions are incorporated for when and how often an appliance is operated. Duration of operation is given as probability density conditional on the start time. Shared use of an appliance by multiple persons is included in the model. Seasonal effects are considered by using changing probability sets during the course of the year. For validation, seven subgroups, which reflect typical household configurations, were formed and tested against measured field data from 430 households in 9 different cities across Germany. The results showed an accuracy of 91% and a correlation of up to 0.98.

Abstract: Energy demand characteristics were surveyed and measured throughout Korea to establish load models for three types of buildings: hotels, hospitals, and offices. The consumption of electricity and fuel was collected and statistically analysed to establish four types of building loads: electricity, heating, hot water, and cooling energy. The annual, monthly, daily, and hourly patterns of the four load types were derived for the three building types. Key statistical values such as the annual mean, maximum, and minimum values are provided. A procedure is presented to compose building load models as a time series covering the 8760 h of a year by combining daily and hourly patterns. The key features of the load models were compared to better understand the energy consumption characteristics of the three building types. Substantial variations in the magnitudes and patterns were observed among the types of buildings and loads. The load models can be applied to a wide range of problems in building energy system design and planning, including simulations and optimizations of community energy systems.

Abstract: Access to electricity is widely recognized as an important factor for economic and social development. Low rates of access, particularly in remote rural areas in regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia, have led developing nations and international organizations to set ambitious goals to expand the reach of electricity. Decentralized solutions such as microgrids have been proposed as cost effective solutions to reaching communities located far from central grid infrastructure. Lack of capital from public and donor sources has severely impeded achieving access goals, leading to calls for greater private sector participation in electrification activities. However, due to the high level of risk associated with decentralized electrification projects in low-income areas, marginal expected returns on investment, and a lack of clear and effective public policy, the private sector has not shown significant interest in participating in such projects. The purpose of this paper is to review barriers to private sector participation in decentralized electrification projects and to identify solutions that have been implemented and proposed to overcome these barriers. The barriers discussed include unsecure revenue streams, inability to finance projects, and long-term project risks such as grid encroachment. The range of interventions and business models reviewed include methods to secure reliable demand, subsidy models, risk guarantees, and different revenue models. This paper does not include an analysis of the effectiveness of the different interventions described. Future research should evaluate the relative costs and benefits of these interventions in order to provide robust policy guidance to decision makers in developing countries.

Abstract: In this study, a hybrid power system consisting of PV (Photovoltaics) panels, a wind turbine and a biogas engine is proposed to supply the electricity demand of a village in Kenya. The average and the peak load of the village are around 8 kW and 16.5 kW respectively. The feasibility of using locally produced biogas to drive a backup engine in comparison to using a diesel engine as backup has been explored through a techno-economic analysis using HOMER (Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewables). This hybrid system has also been compared with a single diesel based power system. The results show that the hybrid system integrated with the biogas engine as backup can be a better solution than using a diesel engine as backup. The share of power generation by PV, wind and biogas are 49%, 19% and 32%, respectively. The LCOE (Levelized Cost of Electricity) of generated electricity by this hybrid system ($0.25/kWh) is about 20% cheaper than that with a diesel engine as backup ($0.31/kWh), while the capital cost and the total NPC (Net Present Cost) are about 30% and 18% lower, respectively. Regarding CO2 emissions, using a biogas engine as backup saves 17 tons of CO2 per year compared to using the diesel engine as backup.

Abstract: Rural electrification improves the quality of life of rural dwellers having limited or non-access to electricity through decentralized electricity coverage. Since the price of oil is unstable and fluctuating day by day and grid expansion is not also a cost effective solution, integrating renewable energy sources thus become an important alternative for rural electrification. The present study investigated the feasibility of different power generation configurations comprising solar array, wind turbine and diesel generator in different locations within the geo-political zones of Nigeria. Six rural communities were randomly chosen from each of the six geo-political zones in Nigeria with the intention that the results of the study could be replicated in other remote locations of the selected zones with similar terrains. HOMER (Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewable) simulation software was used to determine the economic feasibility of the systems. The simulations concentrated on the net present costs, cost of energy and renewable fraction of the given hybrid configurations for all the climatic zones. The analysis indicates that the PV/diesel/battery hybrid renewable system configuration is found as optimum architecture for both sensitivity cases of 1.1 and $1.3/l of diesel. It also displayed better performance in fuel consumption and CO2 reduction.

Abstract: The present study uses the DHW (domestic hot water) electric backup from solar thermal systems to optimize the total electricity dispatch of an isolated mini-grid. The proposed approach estimates the hourly DHW load, and proposes and simulates different DR (demand response) strategies, from the supply side, to minimize the dispatch costs of an energy system. The case study consists on optimizing the electricity load, in a representative day with low solar radiation, in Corvo Island, Azores. The DHW backup is induced by three different demand patterns. The study compares different DR strategies: backup at demand (no strategy), pre-scheduled backup using two different imposed schedules, a strategy based on linear programming, and finally two strategies using genetic algorithms, with different formulations for DHW backup – one that assigns number of systems and another that assigns energy demand. It is concluded that pre-determined DR strategies may increase the generation costs, but DR strategies based on optimization algorithms are able to decrease generation costs. In particular, linear programming is the strategy that presents the lowest increase on dispatch costs, but the strategy based on genetic algorithms is the one that best minimizes both daily operation costs and total energy demand, of the system.

Abstract: In recent years, renewable energy can be seen as one of the important prospect of today's research, as it is likely to enlighten the lives of millions of people by fulfilling demand of electricity in their daily life. The present work focuses on the development of optimal hybrid energy system sizing model based on comparative analysis of particle swarm optimization, genetic algorithm and Homer software for energy index ratio of 1. The model also incorporates renewable fraction, emissions of carbon di oxide from diesel generator, net present cost and cost of energy. The system is developed to supply the demand of 7 un-electrified villages of Dhauladevi block of Almora district in Uttarakhand, India with the help of the available resources of solar, hydro, biomass and biogas energy along with the addition of diesel generator, for meeting out the energy deficit. From the optimization results, minimum cost of energy and maximum renewable fraction are obtained as 5.77 Rs/kWh and 92.6% respectively.

Abstract: We introduce an integrated model for characterization of spatiotemporal building energy consumption patterns in neighborhoods and city districts. The model addresses the need for a comprehensive method to identify present and potential states of building energy consumption in the context of urban transformation. The focus lies on determining the spatiotemporal variability of energy services in both standing and future buildings in the residential, commercial and industrial sectors. This detailed characterization facilitates the assessment of potential energy efficiency measures at the neighborhood and city district scales. In a novel approach we integrated existing methods in urban and energy planning domains such as spatial analysis, dynamic building energy modeling and energy mapping to provide a comprehensive, multi-scale and multi-dimensional model of analysis. The model is part of a geographic information system (GIS), which serves as a platform for the allocation and future dissemination of spatiotemporal data. The model is validated against measured data and a peer model for a city district in Switzerland. In this context, we present practical applications in the analysis of energy efficiency measures in buildings and urban zoning. We furthermore discuss potential applications in educational, urban and energy planning practices.

Abstract: District heating systems can play significant role in achieving stringent targets for CO2 emissions with concurrent increase in fuel efficiency. However, there are a lot of the potentials for future improvement of their operation. One of the potential domains is control and prediction. Control of the most district heating systems is feed forward without any feedback from consumers. With reliable predictions of consumers heat need, production could be altered to match the real consumers’ needs. This will have effect on lowering the distribution cost, heat losses and especially on lowered return secondary and primary temperature which will result in increase of overall efficiency of combined heat and power plants. In this paper, to predict the heat load for individual consumers in district heating systems, an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inferences system (ANFIS) was constructed. Simulation results indicate that further improvements on model are needed especially for prediction horizons greater than 1h.

Abstract: The sizing of a stand-alone wind-photovoltaic-battery hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) is greatly influenced by socio-demographic factors however, few studies have examined how socio-demographic factors, as borne out by different electrical usage patterns, influence the size of HRESs. This paper investigates how these factors influence the optimal sizing of a stand-alone HRES using a hybrid optimization method to match the available renewable energy with the demand. In this regard, different energy usage patterns resulting from users socio-demographic profile have been investigated and used for the optimal sizing of a HRES. The results show that the electricity usage profile of a site has a significant impact on the sizing and design of the system. Further, the results illustrate that one can design a system that meets the demand profiles resulting from socio-demographic factors with a minimum unmet load; however, by optimizing systems to the users socio-demographic profile, significant cost savings can be made.

Abstract: This article introduces a modified simulated annealing optimization approach for automatically determining optimal energy management strategies in grid-connected, storage-augmented, photovoltaics-supplied prosumer buildings and neighborhoods based on user-specific goals. For evaluating the modified simulated annealing optimizer, a number of test scenarios in the field of energy self-consumption maximization are defined and results are compared to a gradient descent and a total state space search approach. The benchmarking against these two reference methods demonstrates that the modified simulated annealing approach is able to find significantly better solutions than the gradient descent algorithm – being equal or very close to the global optimum – with significantly less computational effort and processing time than the total state space search approach.

Abstract: This paper describes the extension of CREST’s existing electrical domestic demand model into an integrated thermal–electrical demand model. The principle novelty of the model is its integrated structure such that the timing of thermal and electrical output variables are appropriately correlated. The model has been developed primarily for low-voltage network analysis and the model’s ability to account for demand diversity is of critical importance for this application. The model, however, can also serve as a basis for modelling domestic energy demands within the broader field of urban energy systems analysis. The new model includes the previously published components associated with electrical demand and generation (appliances, lighting, and photovoltaics) and integrates these with an updated occupancy model, a solar thermal collector model, and new thermal models including a low-order building thermal model, domestic hot water consumption, thermostat and timer controls and gas boilers. The paper reviews the state-of-the-art in high-resolution domestic demand modelling, describes the model, and compares its output with three independent validation datasets. The integrated model remains an open-source development in Excel VBA and is freely available to download for users to configure and extend, or to incorporate into other models.

Abstract: This study highlights the forthcoming problem with diminishing environmental benefits from heat demand reducing energy conservation measures (ECM) of buildings within district heating systems (DHS), as the supply side is becoming “greener” and more primary energy efficient. In this study heat demand profiles and annual electricity-to-heat factors of ECMs in buildings are computed and their impact on system efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions of a Swedish biomass fuelled and combined heat and power utilising DHS are assessed. A weather normalising method for the DHS heat load is developed, combining segmented multivariable linear regressions with typical meteorological year weather data to enable the DHS model and the buildings model to work under the same weather conditions. Improving the buildings’ envelope insulation level and thereby levelling out the DHS heat load curve reduces greenhouse gas emissions and improves primary energy efficiency. Reducing household electricity use proves to be highly beneficial, partly because it increases heat demand, allowing for more cogeneration of electricity. However the other ECMs considered may cause increased greenhouse gas emissions, mainly because of their adverse impact on the cogeneration of electricity. If biomass fuels are considered as residuals, and thus assigned low primary energy factors, primary energy efficiency decreases when implementing ECMs that lower heat demand.

Abstract: A large number of populations of the world; especially in developing countries; are living in rural or remote areas those are geographically isolated from the grid connection. Power supply and uninterrupted fuel transportation to produce electrical power for these areas poses a great challenge. Using renewable energy in off grid hybrid energy system might be a pathway to solve this problem. Malaysia is a hilly land with the gift of renewable energy resources. There is a possibility to utilize these renewable resources to produce electrical power and to limit the dependency on the fossil fuel. In this perspective, a research is carried out to analyze the performance of an off-grid PV (photovoltaic)-wind-diesel-battery hybrid energy system for a remote area named “KLIA Sepang Station” located in the state of Selangor, Malaysia. The system is designed as well as simulated to support a small community considering an average load demand of 33 kWh/day with a peak load of 3.9 kW. The simulation and optimization of operations of the system have been done by HOMER (Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewable) software using the real time field data of solar radiation and wind speed of that area. The simulation ensures that the system is suitably feasible with respect to net present cost (NPC) and CO2 emission reduction purpose. The result shows that NPC and CO2 emission can be reduced about 29.65% and 16 tons per year respectively compared to the conventional power plants. The NPC of the optimized system has been found about USD 288,194.00 having the per unit Cost of Energy (COE) about USD 1.877/kWh. The analyzed hybrid energy system might be applicable for other region of the world where the climate conditions are similar.

Abstract: District heating systems operation can be improved by control strategies. One of the options is the introduction of predictive control model. Predictive models of heat load can be applied to improve district heating system performances. In this article, short-term multistep-ahead predictive models of heat load for consumers connected to district heating system were developed using SVMs (Support Vector Machines) with FFA (Firefly Algorithm). Firefly algorithm was used to optimize SVM parameters. Seven SVM-FFA predictive models for different time horizons were developed. Obtained results of the SVM-FFA models were compared with GP (genetic programming), ANNs (artificial neural networks), and SVMs models with grid search algorithm. The experimental results show that the developed SVM-FFA models can be used with certainty for further work on formulating novel model predictive strategies in district heating systems.

Abstract: The proliferation of off-grid photovoltaic (PV) systems is rapidly increasing in the least developed countries. The sizing of system components—primarily PV panels and batteries—is critically influenced by the expected daily load. However, accurately estimating incipient electrical load of rural consumers is fraught with challenges. Load estimation error is propagated through the design phase, potentially resulting in a system that is unduly expensive or fails to meet reliability targets. This article investigates the effects of daily load estimation error on system design, cost and reliability. Load and insolation data from seven off-grid systems in Malawi were collected. The systems were redesigned using three different intuitive design approaches considering different levels of load estimation error, ranging from ±90% of the actual measured load. The cost of each design is estimated from in-country prices. The reliability of each design is determined from an hourly simulation using the measured data. The results show that PV array and battery sizing scale proportionately with load estimation error and that the cost of load over-estimation is approximately US$1.92 to US$6.02 per watthour, whereas under-estimation can precipitously degrade reliability. A cost-versus-reliability analysis shows that for the Malawi systems, on average 46% of the PV and battery costs are used to improve the simulated hourly reliability from 99% to 100%. Moreover, the results point to the challenges with intuitive design approaches, showing that consideration of average load alone can lead to over- or under-designed systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we describe the development, implementation and application of a novel mathematical procedure devoted to formulating the daily load profiles of off-grid consumers in rural areas. The procedure aims at providing such profiles as input data for the design process of off-grid systems for rural electrification. Indeed, daily load profiles represent an essential input for off-grid systems capacity planning methods based on steady-state energy simulation and lifetime techno-economic analyses, and for the analysis of the logics to control the energy fluxes among the different system components. Nevertheless, no particular attention has been devoted so far in the scientific literature as regards specific approaches for daily load profiles estimates for rural consumers. In order to contribute to covering this gap, we developed a new mathematical procedure taking into consideration the specific features of rural areas. The procedure is based on a set of data that can be surveyed and/or assumed in rural areas, and it relies on a stochastic bottom-up approach with correlations between the different load profile parameters (i.e. load factor, coincidence factor and number of consumers) in order to build up the coincidence behavior of the electrical appliances. We have implemented the procedure in a software tool (LoadProGen) which can eventually support the off-grid systems design process for rural electrification. Finally, we have applied the procedure to a case study in order to clarify the proposed approach.

Abstract: Due to an expanding integration of renewable energy resources in the power systems, mismatches between electricity supply and demand will increase. A promising solution to deal with these issues is Demand Response (DR), which incentives end-users to be flexible in their electricity consumption. This paper presents a bottom up simulation model that generates office building electricity load profiles representative for Northern Europe. The model connects behavioral aspects of office workers with electricity usage from appliances, and physical representation of the building to describe the energy use of the Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning systems. To validate the model, simulations are performed with respect to two data sets, and compared with real load measurements. The validation shows that the model can reproduce load profiles with reasonable accuracy for both data sets. With the presented model approach, it is possible to define simple portfolio office building models which subsequently can be used for simulation and analysis of DR in the power systems.

Abstract: The objective is to present a high-resolution model of household electricity use developed based upon a combination of measured and statistical data. It is a bottom-up model, which uses the 1-min cycle power use characteristics of a single appliance as the main building block. The effect of parameters, such as the number of occupants and their attitude towards energy use is included in the model. Moreover, the model accounts for phenomena related to unexpected weather conditions and local/national events, e.g. TV shows. The main aim of model is to generate high-resolution household load profiles for investigation of flexibility potential of domestic appliances and network modelling. The model is validated with two datasets of 1-h and 5-min data from 89 to 16 households, respectively. The comparison between measured and modelled values indicates that model well captures the characteristics of domestic electricity load profiles on a daily as well seasonal basis. For high-resolution data, the model represents well the differences in demand between households of dissimilar size as well as the diversity of demand between households of the same size. For the individual household, the high-end power consumption is under-represented since the timing of peaks is more diverse in the model.

Abstract: In the residential sector, with the introduction of electric vehicles and photovoltaics, developments are taking place which have an impact on residential load curves. In order to assess the integration of these new types of technologies on both the generation and load side, as well as to develop mitigation strategies like demand side management, detailed information is required about the load curve of a household. To gain knowledge about this load curve a residential load model is developed based on publicly available data. The model utilises a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to model the occupancy in a household based on time use surveys, which together with weather variables, neighbourhood characteristics and behavioural data are used to model the switching pattern of appliances. The modelling approach described in this paper is applied for the situation in the Netherlands. The resulting load curve probability distributions are validated with smart meter measurements for 100 Dutch households for a week. The validation shows that the model presented in this paper can be employed for further studies on demand side management approaches and integration issues of new appliances in distribution grids.

Abstract: Due to the depletion of fossil fuel reserves, it is feared that the world will run out of its energy resources soon. Besides, unpredictable fluctuation of diesel prices in electricity generation is affecting the economy of a country. Thus, for developing country that's economically leans on the use of energy, renewable energy resources should be utilized to meet the increasing energy demand. In this regards, the cogeneration system using renewable energy sources is appropriate, because it has the advantage of producing both electrical power and heat energy from a single fuel. It is suitable for commercial clients like hospital buildings which requires to supply both electric and heat load. Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess the viability to develop a cogeneration system for a hospital building load in Malaysia. The proposed cogeneration system consists of grid connected photovoltaic (PV), fuel cell, and battery. Hybrid optimization model for electric renewable (HOMER) simulation software is used to perform the techno-economic analysis of the proposed system. The proposed system is then compared with other possible configurations. The economical comparison is based on the total net present cost (TNPC), levelized cost of energy (LCOE), renewable fraction, excess energy production and the pollutant gas emission of the system. The simulation result shows that, the proposed cogeneration system has the lowest TNPC, LCOE and operating cost which are $ 106,551, 0.091 $/kWh and 7245 $/yr respectively. Besides, the proposed cogeneration system is proven environmentally friendly as it only produces total 25,873 kg/yr of pollutant gas. The sensitivity analysis where fuel prices and annual interest rate are considered as sensitive parameters, shows impact on the TNPC and LCOE. Finally, the benefit from the Feed in Tariff (FiT) program provided by the government also has been presented.

Abstract: Domestic electricity load profile is essential for energy planning and renewable energy system design. This paper presents analysis of domestic electric load characteristics and a method to model domestic and regional load profile. Multiple Gaussian functions are used to express the load characteristics in the proposed model. This is done by associating the Gaussian function parameters with the peak load changes, e.g. changing height parameters to reflect the peak magnitude. The result of the load curve represented with multiple Gaussian functions allows the model to generate a regional load profile using the number of homes, the number of bedrooms (Nr) and the number of occupants (Np). The proposed model simulates domestic load profile by its load demand change characteristics instead of its appliance ownership and use pattern, etc. Data requirement for the proposed method is significantly lower than the previous top-down and bottom-up approaches. Seasonal change is not included in the present paper, but the method is capable of including seasonal changes if each season’s load demand changes in relation to Np and Nr is available. A demonstration of modelling England and Wales’s national hourly load profile in 2001 and 2011 is presented in this paper. Comparison is made of the proposed method with two other published domestic load profile models. Results show that the proposed method improves the mean percentage errors by at least 5.7% on average hourly load profile.

Abstract: Mini-grids for rural electrification in developing countries are growing in popularity but are not yet widely deployed. A key barrier of mini-grid proliferation is the uncertainty in predicting customer electricity consumption, which adds financial risk. Energy-use surveys deployed in the pre-feasibility stage that capture present and aspirational consumption are intended to reduce this uncertainty. However, the general reliability and accuracy of these surveys has not been demonstrated. This research compares survey-predicted electrical energy use to actual measured consumption of customers of eight mini-grids in rural Kenya. A follow-up audit compares the aspirational inventory of appliances to the realized inventory. The analysis shows that the ability to accurately estimate past consumption based on survey or audit data, even in a relatively short time-horizon is prone to appreciable error — a mean absolute error of 426Wh/day per customer on a mean consumption of 113Wh/day per customer. An alternative data-driven proxy village approach, which uses average customer consumption from each mini-grid to predict consumption at other mini-grids, was more accurate and reduced the mean absolute error to 75Wh/day per customer. Hourly load profiles were constructed to provide insight into potential causes of error and to suggest how the data provided in this work can be used in computer-aided mini-grid design programs.

Abstract: Information on residential power consumption patterns disaggregated at the single-appliance level is an essential requirement for energy utilities and managers to design customized energy demand management strategies. Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) techniques provide this information by decomposing the aggregated electric load measured at the household level by a single-point smart meter into the individual contribution of each end-use. Despite being defined non-intrusive, NILM methods often require an intrusive data sampling process for training purpose. This calibration intrusiveness hampers NILM methods large-scale applications. Other NILM challenges are the limited accuracy in reproducing the end-use consumption patterns and their trajectories in time, which are key to characterize consumers’ behaviors and appliances efficiency, and the poor performance when multiple appliances are simultaneously operated. In this paper we contribute a hybrid, computationally efficient, algorithm for NILM, called Hybrid Signature-based Iterative Disaggregation (HSID), based on the combination of Factorial Hidden Markov Models, which provide an initial approximation of the end-use trajectories, and Iterative Subsequence Dynamic Time Warping, which processes the end-use trajectories in order to match the typical power consumption pattern of each appliance. In order to deal with the challenges posed by intrusive training, a supervised version of the algorithm, requiring appliance-level measurements for calibration, and a semi-supervised version, retrieving appliance-level information from the aggregate smart-metered signal, are proposed. Both versions are demonstrated onto a real-world power consumption dataset comprising five different appliances potentially operated simultaneously. Results show that HSID is able to accurately disaggregate the power consumption measured from a single-point smart meter, thus providing a detailed characterization of the consumers’ behavior in terms of power consumption. Numerical results also demonstrate that HSID is robust with respect to noisy signals and scalable to dataset including a large set of appliances. Finally, the algorithm can be successfully used in non-intrusive experiments without requiring appliance-level measurements, ultimately opening up new opportunities to foster the deployment of large-scale smart metering networks, as well as the design and practical implementation of personalized demand management strategies.

Abstract: This paper is devoted to describe the development, implementation and application of a novel procedure to properly design the electrification process in rural areas of Emerging Countries (EC). The procedure exploits a bottom-up approach, i.e. target applications are related to micro-grids devoted to satisfy the electrical needs of small communities. The procedure starts from microscopic data (i.e. single electric appliances) to effectively catch the customer needs (i.e. bottom) and it matches them with the available energy sources in the target area. In particular, a tool named LoadProGen developed by the Energy4Growing research group of Politecnico di Milano, is presented: the mathematical approach proposed is detailed and a real field case study relevant to a micro-grid deployed in Tanzania is provided. The tool is based on the gathering of information about the target area, i.e. to get information from interview and field audit, and on a stochastic approach to build up realistic estimation of the electric load profile of the considered uses. The energy needs forecast (cfr. load profile) is then adopted in a second procedure devoted to design a micro-grid capable to properly feed the loads. In this work, for sake of exemplification, this latter is supposed to be a photovoltaic based micro-grid integrated with an electrochemical storage.

Abstract: The assessment of off-grid electrification programs in developing countries largely based on mini-grid and solar home system (SHS) has shown that they are faced with low development imparts and sustainability challenges, which has resulted in failure of many projects. This study provides solutions on how to surmount these challenges, leaning on the experience of a hybrid solar-diesel mini-grid at Tsumkwe village in Namibia. It provides analyses of a case study based on empirical evidence from field studies, interviews of representatives of households, public institutions and energy providers. In addition, it investigates the technical challenges and economic impacts of the electrification program. HOMER™ and MATLAB™ models were used in the analysis and investigations. The findings show that despite the challenges, the system has been sustained because it keyed into an existing structure with growth potentials. The progressive tariff system adopted by the government helped to cushion costs and allow low income households in the energy matrix. Adoption of strict maintenance measures, and implementation of energy efficiency measures prior to the commissioning of the program, resulted in the reduction of costs. The success elements identified in this study could be extrapolated in other sub-Saharan African countries if the challenges are properly addressed.

Abstract: A microgrid system, be it connected to the utility grid or an independent system, usually consists of a mix of generation - renewable and non-renewable; loads - controllable or non-controllable and Energy Storage Systems (ESSs) such as batteries or flywheels. In order to determine how much power is utilized from the controllable resources such as ESS, diesel generators, micro-turbines or gas turbines, we first need to determine how much the demand is or how much the renewable energy sources are generating is which is accomplished using forecasting techniques. Due to the intermittent nature of renewable resources such as wind energy or solar energy, it is difficult to forecast wind power or solar power accurately. These forecasts are highly dependent on weather forecasts. It is evident that forecast of any data based on forecast of other parameters would lead to further inaccuracy, even if the relation between the inputs and output maybe predetermined through regression methods. Therefore, this paper illustrates an approach to use historical power data instead of numerical weather predictions to produce short-term forecast results. The concept is based on persistence method presented in [1]. This method uses the “today equals tomorrow” concept. From [2], we know that persistence technique produces results that are more accurate as compared to other forecasting techniques for a look-ahead time of 4-6 hours. Both [1] and [2] were based on wind power forecasting. In this paper, we investigate persistence method for short-term electrical demand, solar PV (Photovoltaic) power and wind power forecasting. Since the forecasts are dependent on historical averages of the data in the ‘near’ past, the accuracy is inversely proportional to the variation of power between the historical data and the actual data.

Abstract: Indian power supply is dominated by large coal based power plants connected to the national grid. Though it is economically viable for large consumption in industries but it may not be sustainable for many poor Indian villages, specifically for remote off-grid connection. Decentralized small scale power or even multi utility systems using local resources may be a sustainable option for these villages. Multi-utility energy system, i.e. polygeneration helps to cater to the secondary energy needs of a locality. But the secondary energy supply should be available at affordable cost. Minimization of the cost of secondary energy helps to increase the economic acceptability of a distributed energy system. In this paper, a polygeneration with solar PV, biomass power, ethanol production unit and cooling is proposed for an Indian off grid village. An economic model developed in MATLAB using linear programming approach to determine the optimal size of the system by maximization of the annualized profit has been reported. Results show that multiple energy utility supply is possible through distributed polygeneration. This renewable energy based polygeneration reduce CO2 emission significantly as compared to diesel generator set. Reliability and sensitivity analysis as well as comparison of estimated performance for four different locations in India is reported.

Abstract: Mini-grids are seen as an important option for increasing access to electricity in non-electrified rural areas where grid-extension is unfeasible. Appropriately dimensioning and constructing mini-grids requires knowledge of electricity usage. There is currently a lack of measured load profiles from mini-grids and the most common method for estimating electricity usage is through appliance data collected via interviews. Thus, this paper compares and investigates the differences between measured daily load profiles and daily load profiles created from appliance data collected through interviews and how the two methods impact the dimensioning and operation of a mini-grid. This is done by comparing load profiles for an entire mini-grid, a household and SME customers with large loads. The paper reports differing results from the two methodologies. Generally, the results show that the interview-based load profiles fail to provide an accurate overall estimate. The calculated performance metrics for the two methods also shows large differences. The interview-based load profiles mainly fail to provide accurate estimates of energy and the energy related (capacity factor and load factor) performance metrics. Accordingly, the implications for mini-grid operators and developers could be significant. The interview-based load profiles indicate the mini-grid system to be considerably less technically and economically desirable than measurements show. Suggestions for how the interview process can be improved are presented.

Abstract: PV and wind hybrid are found to be the most lucrative solution for the diminishing traditional energy sources. Whereas these alternatives sources of the energy have many remarkable rewards like cost of energy and feasibility etc. The attributes of these sources of being cost effective and stable are possible due to their complementary nature as compared to independent energy systems. Therefore, these systems have admirable capability to meet energy crisis up to some extent. The proposed work gives the idea about various configuration, control strategy, techno-economic analysis and social effect. The findings of comprehensive review will help for further improvements in hybrid system design and control with respect to practical system implementation. This paper also presents a case study of remote area Barwani, India and results are compared using Homer and PSO. The resulting analysis reveals that configurations of hybrid system are the most techno-economical feasible solution concerning COE, renewable fraction, maximum renewable penetration, levelized cost, operating cost, mean electrical efficiency, and emission amongst various hybrid system configurations using PSO as compared to HOMER.

Abstract: The relationship among occupants’ presence, activities and appliance use is essential for households’ energy use. In the present work, we aimed to link occupants’ energy-related activities to electricity demand, in order to obtain a representative daily electricity load profile for Danish households using Danish time-use survey (DTUS) data. The approach was to combine appliance ownership and power ratings with occupant activities from the DTUS. Two modelling approaches were implemented: in the first approach, the occupant activities profiles from the DTUS were used directly to determine activities at 10-minute intervals. In the second approach, the probabilities of starting time and duration of the occupant activities were used to determine activities. In both approaches, appliance use was assigned to the energy-related activities. The set of appliances used in each activity was determined from a national database of appliance ownership, and the appliances’ power was calibrated using information from apartments in Copenhagen, Denmark. The modelled daily electricity load profile was compared with three measured datasets of varying sizes and from different parts of Denmark. Both approaches captured important qualitative characteristics of the measured load profiles. However, the first approach used a more simple method and resulted in smaller errors than the second approach.

Abstract: Energy access projects in remote off-grid areas would benefit from the adoption of a multi-energy system perspective, addressing all energy needs – not only lighting and power appliances, but also water-heating and cooking – by means of a mix of energy vectors. However, multi-energy analyses in remote areas are hindered by a lack of models allowing for the generation of multi-energy load profiles based on interview-based information characterised by high uncertainty. This study proposes a novel open-source bottom-up stochastic model specifically conceived for the generation of multi-energy loads for systems located in remote areas. The model is tested and validated against data obtained from a real system, showing a very good approximation of measured profiles, with percentage errors consistently below 2% for all the selected indicators, and an improved accuracy compared to existing approaches. In particular, some innovative features – such as the possibility to define and modulate throughout the day appliances’ duty cycles – seem to be determinant in marking a difference with previous approaches. This might arguably be even more beneficial for case studies characterised by a larger penetration of appliances that are subject to complex and unpredictable duty cycle behaviour.

Abstract: Efforts towards ensuring clean and affordable electricity for all have been progressing slowly in rural, off grid areas of developing countries. In this context, hybrid microgrids may offer reliable and potentially clean electricity for isolated locations. Nevertheless, the process of planning and operation of these systems faces several challenges, often due to the uncertainties related to the renewable resources and to the stochastic nature of electricity consumption in rural contexts. This paper tackles this problem and contributes to the literature in bridging the gap between field practices and two-stage stochastic modeling approaches by identifying an open-source modeling framework which is then applied to real local data. As reference case-study, we consider a microgrid built in 2015 in Bolivia. Overall, the optimal system results from a compromise between the Net Present Cost, the peak capacity installed and the flexibility (to balance variable generation). Different approaches to size isolated microgrids are tested, with the conclusion that methods accounting for the uncertainty in both demand and renewable generation may lead to a more robust configuration with little impacts on the final cost for the community.

Abstract: Having continuous load structure and composition information of substations has a great relevance in power system analysis such as load modeling, load forecasting and demand-side management. In this paper, a parsimonious approach for load composition estimation using non-intrusive load disaggregation techniques for low voltage substations is presented with a concept of using ZIP load model characteristics of the aggregate active and reactive powers as predictor features. The disaggregation system uses machine learning algorithms such as Function Fitting Multi-Layer Perceptron Artificial Neural Network (MLP-ANN), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). During the study, a simulation dataset was generated using Monte Carlo simulation. Moreover, a comparative analysis with a benchmarked paper has been assessed and the proposed approach significantly outperforms.

Abstract: Electric power systems are undergoing significant changes in all sectors at all voltage levels. The growing penetration of Renewable Energy Resources (RES), the liberalization of energy markets, the spread of active customers, the increasing diffusion of green energy policies to foster sustainable and low-emission policies, represent the main drivers in the evolution of the electric system. For these reasons, Distribution System Operators (DSO) are asked to adopt modern Distribution Management Systems (DMS) in order to manage RES uncertainties for an efficient, flexible and economic operation of distribution systems. In this context, the paper presents the design and the implementation in a real DMS of two advanced functionalities: load forecasting and load modeling. These two algorithms are based on an ensemble of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The good performances obtained on a real distribution network encourage the exploitation of the two proposed techniques to deal with demand uncertainties, in order to use efficiently the controllable resources and to face the stochastic behavior of RES.

Abstract: When optimizing the design of multi-energy systems, the operation strategy and the part-load behavior of the units must be considered in the optimization model, which therefore must be formulated as a two-stage problem. In order to guarantee computational tractability, the operation problem is solved for a limited set of typical and extreme periods. The selection of these periods is an important aspect of the design methodology, as the selection and sizing of the units is carried out on the basis of their optimal operation in the selected periods. This work proposes a novel Mixed Integer Linear Program clustering model, named k-MILP, devised to find at the same time the most representative days of the year and the extreme days. k-MILP allows controlling the features of the selected typical and extreme days and setting a maximum deviation tolerance on the integral of the load duration curves. The novel approach is tested on the design of two different multi-energy systems (a multiple-site university Campus and a single building) and compared with the two well-known clustering techniques k-means and k-medoids. Results show that k-MILP leads to a better representation of both typical and extreme operating conditions guiding towards more efficient and reliable designs.

Abstract: In the framework of distributed energy planning, evaluating reliable energy profiles of different sectors has a prominent role. At the same time, it is a quite challenging task, since the availability of actual energy profiles of buildings at the district level is not widespread. A survey of over 70 studies in scientific literature has been accomplished and a set of criteria has been defined for classifying the selected contributions based on the energy demand data features, source and/or estimation methods, highlighting the ones adopting hourly energy profiles. As final results, tables summarizing the main methods characteristics and a selection of studies providing directly useable energy profiles are reported. Therefore, this study could be useful for stakeholders involved in energy simulations of buildings stocks and community energy planning in assessing the buildings energy demand, with different desired level of detail and available data. The research, broadly, demonstrates that the potential replicability of analysed methods is constrained to the datasets availability and, particularly, highlights the need of reliable hourly energy profiles definition for developing accurate energy scenarios.

Abstract: Fueled by big data, powerful and affordable computing resources, and advanced algorithms, machine learning has been explored and applied to buildings research for the past decades and has demonstrated its potential to enhance building performance. This study systematically surveyed how machine learning has been applied at different stages of building life cycle. By conducting a literature search on the Web of Knowledge platform, we found 9579 papers in this field and selected 153 papers for an in-depth review. The number of published papers is increasing year by year, with a focus on building design, operation, and control. However, no study was found using machine learning in building commissioning. There are successful pilot studies on fault detection and diagnosis of HVAC equipment and systems, load prediction, energy baseline estimate, load shape clustering, occupancy prediction, and learning occupant behaviors and energy use patterns. None of the existing studies were adopted broadly by the building industry, due to common challenges including (1) lack of large scale labeled data to train and validate the model, (2) lack of model transferability, which limits a model trained with one data-rich building to be used in another building with limited data, (3) lack of strong justification of costs and benefits of deploying machine learning, and (4) the performance might not be reliable and robust for the stated goals, as the method might work for some buildings but could not be generalized to others. Findings from the study can inform future machine learning research to improve occupant comfort, energy efficiency, demand flexibility, and resilience of buildings, as well as to inspire young researchers in the field to explore multidisciplinary approaches that integrate building science, computing science, data science, and social science.

Abstract: This paper demonstrates the optimum design and techno-economic assessment of hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) for rural electrification in the remote district of Korkadu, India. The renewable energy resources namely solar photovoltaic, wind turbine and bio generators are considered as the main sources because of its high potential in Korkadu district. This paper estimates the load forecasting for the selected district, which is a mixture of different load patterns namely residential, commercial, institutional and agricultural demands. The desired HRES has to meet the forecasted load demand for reliable electrification. The optimum design and techno-economic analysis of proposed HRES system is carried using powerful tool HOMER. This study also compares HRES’s operational behavior with different operational strategies such as load following strategy, cycle charging strategy and combined strategy of the system. The outcome of the proposed dispatched strategy expressed the contribution of solar power as 86.8%, wind as 12.7% and bio gen power as 0.5% to meet out developed rural load pattern with 6.8% of battery bank losses and 1.78% of converter losses. This research work also illustrate the HRES based power generation can be a cost effective sustainable power alternative to the conventional grid extension system.

Abstract: Building electrical load profiles can improve understanding of building energy efficiency, demand flexibility, and building-grid interactions. Current approaches to generating load profiles are time-consuming and not capable of reflecting the dynamic and stochastic behaviors of real buildings; some approaches also trigger data privacy concerns. In this study, we proposed a novel approach for generating realistic electrical load profiles of buildings through the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), a machine learning technique that is capable of revealing an unknown probability distribution purely from data. The proposed approach has three main steps: (1) normalizing the daily 24-hour load profiles, (2) clustering the daily load profiles with the k-means algorithm, and (3) using GAN to generate daily load profiles for each cluster. The approach was tested with an open-source database – the Building Data Genome Project. We validated the proposed method by comparing the mean, standard deviation, and distribution of key parameters of the generated load profiles with those of the real ones. The KL divergence of the generated and real load profiles are within 0.3 for majority of parameters and clusters. Additionally, results showed the load profiles generated by GAN can capture not only the general trend but also the random variations of the actual electrical loads in buildings. The proposed GAN approach can be used to generate building electrical load profiles, verify other load profile generation models, detect changes to load profiles, and more importantly, anonymize smart meter data for sharing, to support research and applications of grid-interactive efficient buildings.

Abstract: Small-scale off-grid renewable energy systems are being increasingly used for rural electrification, commonly as stand-alone home systems or community micro-grids. With the variety of technologies and configurations available, it is not clear which options are sustainable for remote communities. This study investigates the life cycle environmental sustainability of both home and community installations, designed as part of this work, which utilise diesel, solar, and wind resources coupled with battery storage. A total of 21 system configurations (six home systems and 15 micro-grids) have been designed and optimised for a prototypical rural community in the Philippines, considering both stand-alone and hybrid systems. Life cycle assessment (LCA) considering 18 potential impact categories has been carried out to compare the environmental impacts associated with electricity production of each option. At the household level, hybrid solar photovoltaics (PV)-wind systems with storage have 17–40% lower impacts than the equivalent stand-alone installations per kWh generated. Batteries are a major environmental hotspot, causing up to 88% of the life cycle impacts of a home energy system. Among the community micro-grid options, the PV-wind-lead acid battery hybrid system has the lowest impacts in many categories, including climate change, ozone depletion, and acidification. Comparing equivalent architectures for single-household and community-scale installations, PV systems are environmentally more sustainable if installed individually in households, while larger turbines in community micro-grids are environmentally better for wind utilisation. The results suggest that a household-scale PV system integrated within a micro-grid with community-scale wind turbines and Li-ion batteries is environmentally the most sustainable configuration.

Abstract: This paper presents an analysis of the path towards a clean energy transition in rural areas, from the time that households do not have electricity access from any source, to when they get access to the national electricity; considering the intermediate access to an off-grid renewable technology, as well as the post-electrification years. For this, field household-level data are collected through surveys and electricity consumption measurements in rural Kenya. Potential electricity access transitions were analyzed, in which the determinants of grid-electricity and solar home system (SHS) adoption were identified, finding that factors such as peer-pressure, good quality housing materials, and a male as household head will increase the probabilities to up to 45% for grid-electricity adoption. Increasing the electricity price and the unreliability of the electricity service will have a negative effect on these probabilities, reducing them at rates from 5 to 22%. Households that had access to a SHS before getting grid-electricity connection are likely to consume 9 kWh/month (equivalent to 142KSh/month) more than those that did not have access to it. Results also show that women as decision-makers have a key role in the energy transition, as female-headed households are keener to move to cleaner fuels at an early stage. The post-electrification consumption peak is likely to occur until the third year of connection, as households acquire more power-consuming appliances; however, this is greatly affected by the electricity grid unreliability. These findings intend to fill in the knowledge gap on understanding each step of the energy ladder in rural areas, which can potentially support the design of energy access interventions and policy strategies.

Abstract: To design energy access solutions for rural households in developing countries it is important to have an accurate estimation of what their electricity consumption is. Studies reveal that they mainly use electricity to meet their lighting needs, as they cannot afford high power-consuming appliances. However, the scarce data availability and modeling complexity are a challenge to compute correctly the load profiles without collecting data on-site. This paper presents a methodology that computes the hourly lighting load profiles of rural households in East Africa requiring a small amount of publicly available input data. Combining data from household surveys, climate, and satellite imagery, the methodology applies machine learning for determining occupant behavior patterns, and lamps ownership for indoor and outdoor usage. For this, an average prediction accuracy of 80% is reached. After applying lighting requirement functions, load profiles are generated and then validated using measured data from 13 households in Kenya. Results show that the methodology is able to compute the load profiles with an average normalized root mean squared error of 0.7%, which is less compared to existing simulation approaches using on-site data. To demonstrate a broad application, the monthly lighting consumption is computed and projected geospatially for households in Kenya.

Abstract: Building consumption data is integral to numerous applications including retrofit analysis, Smart Grid integration and optimization, and load forecasting. Still, due to technical limitations, privacy concerns and the proprietary nature of the industry, usable data is often unavailable for research and development. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) - which generate synthetic instances that resemble those from an original training dataset - have been proposed to help address this issue. Previous studies use GANs to generate building sequence data, but the models are not typically designed for time series problems, they often require relatively large amounts of input data (at least 20,000 sequences) and it is unclear whether they correctly capture the temporal behaviour of the buildings. In this work we implement a conditional temporal GAN that addresses these issues, and we show that it exhibits state-of-the-art performance on small datasets. 22 different experiments that vary according to their data inputs are benchmarked using Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) and predictive forecasting validation error. Of these, the best performing is also evaluated using a curated set of metrics that extends those of previous work to include PCA, deep-learning based forecasting and measurements of trend and seasonality. Two case studies are included: one for residential and one for commercial buildings. The model achieves a JSD of 0.012 on the former data and 0.037 on the latter, using only 396 and 156 original load sequences, respectively.

Abstract: As household electrification rates continue to increase globally, the focus in energy access planning is increasingly shifting towards quality of service. To inform this planning, we explore changes in household electricity and people's use and satisfaction with their service over time in rural India. Fielded in 2015, the ACCESS survey collected data on energy access from more than 8,500 households living across six Indian states. In 2018, the same households were re-surveyed. Using this longitudinal dataset, we sketch the changes in electricity access that took place during these three years. We find that access and the quality of supply have both improved substantially, with a 17 percentage points increase in electrification rates (95% CI: [15,19]). However, a large minority (about one fifth) remains unsatisfied with its electricity access. People's satisfaction levels were more sensitive to the quality of supply in 2018 compared to 2015. We propose that this change is a result of evolving expectations of electricity services that are offered. As households climb electricity access tiers and acquire more and larger electric appliances (such as fans or TVs), their demands increasingly shift from focusing on the extensive margin of supply to its intensive margin.

Abstract: The Government of Bolivia (GoB) aims to provide electricity coverage for all citizens by 2025. This implies reaching remote areas, where electricity access rates are currently below 90% (as of 2018). To achieve this objective, the country has implemented several initiatives, such as the “Living with Dignity” program (PEVD) launched in 2008 to promote access to electricity for all, targeting the country’s poorest areas. Identifying these communities requires relying on different poverty indicators, including the unsatisfied basic needs (UBN) index. This paper focuses on identifying whether the PEVD is targeting the poorest communities. Thus, we explore the criteria that guide the GoB in selecting the areas that should be prioritised. We analyse the suitability of using the UBN index as the social criterion for this purpose. We draw on data provided by the local Censuses of 2001 and 2012. Results suggest that Bolivia’s poorest states, namely those having the highest UBN indices for 2001, experienced the largest improvements in electrification between 2001 and 2012. These results could enable policymakers to target future interventions and prioritise the poor for the provision of electricity access. However, using complementary socio-economic indicators, such as the Multidimensional poverty index (MPI), could complement the traditional UBN index by capturing more relevant information that could lead to a more accurate poverty measurement and rural electrification interventions. In addition, Bolivia is not on track to achieve universal access by 2025 and additional investments should focus on increasing electricity access rates in the states of Potosi, Pando, and Beni.

Abstract: With the vast rural population, the availability of locational renewable energy resources and limited finances in low-income (developing) countries, there is the need for an integrated and holistic energy planning framework to unlock their potential for achieving energy-based economic development. The integrated rural energy planning framework provides a unified road map for energy planning and system design with renewable energy integration geared towards improving energy access in rural areas. Therefore, this study presents the application of case studies to this framework to foster improved localized renewable energy access in low-income (developing) countries. Using rural Nigeria as the geographic scope, the site identification and selection and the locational estimation of annual energy demand steps of the framework are performed for rural areas. Utilizing GIS-based tools, rural communities are identified, and their viable renewable energy resources are estimated. Adopting the reference building approach, seasonal disaggregated energy demand profiles are obtained at community scale with an hourly time-step. These are obtained in the absence of smart-metering equipment and measured datasets on energy use. The obtained results provide insights to inform localized energy policy design by combining rural electrification with energy conservation strategies. This framework has wide applicability across areas with similar energy access and rural development issues especially in sub-Saharan Africa and developing Asia.

Abstract: Electricity access in developing countries, where the availability of public distribution grids is still poor, is considered a key factor for improvement of people life conditions. In these situations, the lack of a reliable grid can be mitigated by the introduction of stand-alone DC microgrids, including small Photovoltaic (PV) generators and storage devices. This paper focuses on optimal energy management and power supply reliability of such a microgrid. In particular, a Model-Predictive-Control (MPC) - based control system is introduced to optimally manage storage devices and coordinate load shedding actions. Additionally, an Artificial-Neural-Network (ANN) - based predictor is introduced to manage unpredictable solar irradiance and temperature variations. The availability of reliable adaptive forecasts provided by the ANN-based predictor increases the efficiency of the optimization performed by the MPC-based control over the prediction horizon, avoiding the well-known issues related to optimization performed on unreliable forecast. In this paper, the proposed control approach is detailed for a specific case study and its advantages with respect to traditional controller algorithms are highlighted by comprehensive numerical simulations. The presented results highlight that the proposed MPC controller provides a substantial increment in power supply reliability with respect to standard controls, especially for priority loads. This is obtained at the expense of an increased battery stress, which is acceptable for electricity access applications where power supply reliability is usually the foremost need.

Abstract: Off-grid renewable energy grids will contribute to the achievement of SDG 7 on universal energy access, especially in off-grid communities. But the scarcity of resources for development aid requires very tight designs that minimize the cost of investment and operation of the mini-grid. To do this, the future energy demand of the community must be analysed very well, which is very difficult due to the lack of previous data. In the literature, two main approaches to analyse future energy demand, deterministic and stochastic methodologies. In this article, we compare both methodologies for a real case study in Honduras and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. Although the deterministic approach requires less information and less mathematical processing, it generates less accurate results. In contrast, the stochastic approach consumes more resources but gives more realistic results for the correct design of the mini-grid. In conclusion, the deterministic approach methods can be useful for the early stages of the project, when the investment is being sized. But for the advanced phases of the project, when the installation is being designed, the stochastic approach is recommended.

Abstract: Aiming at utilizing a large number of distributed energy sources in rural areas such as straw and garbage biomass, rooftop photovoltaics, and decentralized wind power, this study designed a novel structure of a virtual power plant connected with gas-power plant carbon capture (GPPCC), power-to-gas (P2G), and waste incineration power (WI), namely, a GPW-VPP. Then, the information gap decision theory (IGDT) and fuzzy satisfaction method were applied to construct a nearly-zero carbon optimal operation model. In this model, the maximum revenue and minimum carbon emissions were selected as the initial objectives, which were converted into one maximum satisfaction objective. Three uncertainty variables, namely, wind power, photovoltaic power, and user’s load, were described using the IGDT. Secondly, to optimize the distribution of the cooperative operation revenue for the entities in GPW-VPP, a Nash negotiation-based benefit allocation strategy is established considering the multidimensional contribution factors of risks, benefits, and carbon emissions. Finally, the Lankao Rural Energy Revolution Pilot program in China was selected as the case study, the results showed: (1) GPW-VPP can aggregate and utilize different types of distributed energy sources such as rural wind power plants (WPPs) and photovoltaic power generation (PVs) to realize the electricity–carbon–electricity cycle effect. (2) The proposed operation optimization model can measure the uncertainty risk and formulate an optimal plan considering the above dual objectives. When the deviation coefficient of the predicted objectives is 0.5, the uncertainty degree is 0.142, and the cost of the decision plan is less than the expected cost of decision maker. Compared with the maximum revenue objective, the operation revenue and carbon emissions reduced by 4.6% and 35.76% under the comprehensive optimization objective, respectively, (3) The proposed benefit distribution strategy can be used to formulate a better benefit distribution plan that meets the comprehensive contributions of multiple entities. Affected by the risk of output uncertainty, the benefit proportion of WPP and PV increased, but it was 1.64% lower than that in the traditional distribution plan. Affected by carbon emissions, the benefit proportion of biomass power generation decreased, but it was 0.57% higher than that in the traditional distribution plan. Overall, the proposed operation optimization model and benefit distribution strategy can balance the interest requirements of different entities and promote the optimal aggregation and utilization of rural distributed energy resources, which is conducive to the realization of a clean and low-carbon transformation of the overall energy structure.

Abstract: Microgrids are an effective means to provide power to urban and rural communities. Microgrid planning must anticipate both the system's economic feasibility and long-term stability. Due to existing challenging ambitions, limitations, and the uncertainty of renewable energy production, the planning of microgrids is a difficult task. In the present work, a standalone microgrid is planned to integrate solar, wind turbine, diesel generator, and battery for the rural community of the hilly state of Uttarakhand (India). The Feasibility and techno-economic analysis of a proposed microgrid is conducted. The microgrid's performance is investigated using differential evolution and other existing algorithms, particle swarm optimization, and genetic algorithm to ascertain the cheapest option to energize the area. The sizing of components and sensitivity analysis of energy cost with changes in various parameters of the energy system is investigated. The optimization results suggest that the energy cost is $0.16/kWh, with a renewable fraction of 92% and a net present cost of $ 41,078. The obtained results indicated that a renewable-based energy system provides a more effective solution for the electrification of the rural population.

Abstract: Access to clean energy for communities living in remote areas where grid extension is considered unfeasible can be provided by off-grid electrification systems using renewable energy (RE). Especially in developing countries, ensuring the appropriateness of such systems is crucial because it will determine the system's sustainability despite its limited resources. This study demonstrates the design process of an appropriate system by assessing the potential of three RE sources: solar, wind, and biomass in an oil palm and rubber-tree plantation village in South Kalimantan Province, Indonesia. A social assessment is done to avoid sustainability issues of the previously introduced technology intervention by identifying correlations between residents' attributes and satisfaction levels on a selection of social values through multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) and nonparametric methods. The techno-economic assessment and sensitivity analysis uses local data processed with the Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Energy Resources (HOMER) software. Results identified the need for a more appropriate clean energy supply for cooking, the potential role of modern technology, and access to information and communication in income generation, among other needs and opportunities that can be linked with the energy system design. The technical assessment showed that a centralized solar power plant paired with a diesel engine could provide power to the village. However, the cost of electricity (COE) is much higher than the price cap introduced by the national electricity company. This study urges a clear mechanism and a guarantee for the delivery of feed-in-tariffs (FIT) and a price cap exemption for off-grid RE systems. Furthermore, a people-centered public–private partnership business model and a remote capacity-building intervention are also needed. An appropriate energy system design must be supported by an enabling environment and supporting policies to be feasible.

Abstract: Planners at utilities want automated and accurate load forecasts for short-, medium- and long-term load planning. Accurate forecasts are crucial to meet future load demand in response to national growth and to use as a baseline for tariff discussions. Here we propose an end-to-end approach for the data model, forecast model, and forecasting and demand reporting methods. Such an approach can help plan distribution across various geographic areas, such as urban areas, development areas, remote villages/villages, agricultural land, and farms. Such a solution and approach would also look at a top-down forecasting model to consider the electricity consumption pattern relative to macroeconomic factors and weather-related parameters and then disaggregate it while considering distribution losses and other parameters. This model also addresses the rebalancing of peak demand within a feeder. Optimization techniques can create a group of feeders for optimal demand management without needing a new feeder or substation. This study can be used for multiple purposes, and this system can provide a higher degree of predictability and productivity to identify gaps and accelerate reconciliation. Automated and peak load prediction solutions based on data and artificial intelligence can help create a variety of energy demand scenarios for annual peak load and energy requirements. Accurate load prediction can reduce the cost of holding capacity and reliably avoid power and related outages. Automating the forecasting process can help achieve consistent forecasting, supplement field knowledge, and reduce manual errors, leading to timely, high-level forecasts and efficient use of human resources.
