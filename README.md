Abstract: There are varieties of physical and behavioral factors to determine energy demand load profile. The attainment of the optimum mix of measures and renewable energy system deployment requires a simple method suitable for using at the early design stage. A simple method of formulating load profile (SMLP) for UK domestic buildings has been presented in this paper. Domestic space heating load profile for different types of houses have been produced using thermal dynamic model which has been developed using thermal resistant network method. The daily breakdown energy demand load profile of appliance, domestic hot water and space heating can be predicted using this method. The method can produce daily load profile from individual house to urban community. It is suitable to be used at Renewable energy system strategic design stage.

Abstract: Due to the growth of electric end-uses, the management of the variations in time of the electric power demand has become essential, especially in the residential sector. According to this issue, the anticipation of the power demand is of great interest. This implies a better knowledge of the electric load curve of the household stock. Papers about understanding and forecasting energy demand are numerous but studies on building's load curves are rare. In this paper we propose a cross analysis of some existing methods capable of building up a residential electric load curve. Two main types of load curve models have been identified in the literature: top-down and bottom-up methods. Even if the review presents two existing top-down approaches, the authors focused the further analysis on bottom-up models. For each of them we first identify its functional characteristics: finality and scope, input data required, output format, modeled appliances and end-uses covered, generation of the diversity and validation of the model. Secondly, we establish a bloc diagram representing its architecture with focus on the mathematical model chosen. Finally, the authors list the limits of the model in view of the criteria needed to build up an ideal, bottom-up and technically explicit load curve model for the residential sector. A cross reading of the different methodologies is proposed through a global table that characterizes and sums up the analyzed models. Moreover, a graphical representation of the models studied is proposed, according to three criteria (range of application, modelling of the diversity, time scale accuracy) that allows us to compare them “at a glance”. To conclude, an identification of the gaps among existing models is proposed. It consists of listing the end-uses, the appliances and other behavioural correlations which may affect the load curve and that are not included in the reviewed methodologies and need further research.

Abstract: The present study uses the DHW (domestic hot water) electric backup from solar thermal systems to optimize the total electricity dispatch of an isolated mini-grid. The proposed approach estimates the hourly DHW load, and proposes and simulates different DR (demand response) strategies, from the supply side, to minimize the dispatch costs of an energy system. The case study consists on optimizing the electricity load, in a representative day with low solar radiation, in Corvo Island, Azores. The DHW backup is induced by three different demand patterns. The study compares different DR strategies: backup at demand (no strategy), pre-scheduled backup using two different imposed schedules, a strategy based on linear programming, and finally two strategies using genetic algorithms, with different formulations for DHW backup – one that assigns number of systems and another that assigns energy demand. It is concluded that pre-determined DR strategies may increase the generation costs, but DR strategies based on optimization algorithms are able to decrease generation costs. In particular, linear programming is the strategy that presents the lowest increase on dispatch costs, but the strategy based on genetic algorithms is the one that best minimizes both daily operation costs and total energy demand, of the system.

Abstract: With the vast rural population, the availability of locational renewable energy resources and limited finances in low-income (developing) countries, there is the need for an integrated and holistic energy planning framework to unlock their potential for achieving energy-based economic development. The integrated rural energy planning framework provides a unified road map for energy planning and system design with renewable energy integration geared towards improving energy access in rural areas. Therefore, this study presents the application of case studies to this framework to foster improved localized renewable energy access in low-income (developing) countries. Using rural Nigeria as the geographic scope, the site identification and selection and the locational estimation of annual energy demand steps of the framework are performed for rural areas. Utilizing GIS-based tools, rural communities are identified, and their viable renewable energy resources are estimated. Adopting the reference building approach, seasonal disaggregated energy demand profiles are obtained at community scale with an hourly time-step. These are obtained in the absence of smart-metering equipment and measured datasets on energy use. The obtained results provide insights to inform localized energy policy design by combining rural electrification with energy conservation strategies. This framework has wide applicability across areas with similar energy access and rural development issues especially in sub-Saharan Africa and developing Asia.

Abstract: Electricity access in developing countries, where the availability of public distribution grids is still poor, is considered a key factor for improvement of people life conditions. In these situations, the lack of a reliable grid can be mitigated by the introduction of stand-alone DC microgrids, including small Photovoltaic (PV) generators and storage devices. This paper focuses on optimal energy management and power supply reliability of such a microgrid. In particular, a Model-Predictive-Control (MPC) - based control system is introduced to optimally manage storage devices and coordinate load shedding actions. Additionally, an Artificial-Neural-Network (ANN) - based predictor is introduced to manage unpredictable solar irradiance and temperature variations. The availability of reliable adaptive forecasts provided by the ANN-based predictor increases the efficiency of the optimization performed by the MPC-based control over the prediction horizon, avoiding the well-known issues related to optimization performed on unreliable forecast. In this paper, the proposed control approach is detailed for a specific case study and its advantages with respect to traditional controller algorithms are highlighted by comprehensive numerical simulations. The presented results highlight that the proposed MPC controller provides a substantial increment in power supply reliability with respect to standard controls, especially for priority loads. This is obtained at the expense of an increased battery stress, which is acceptable for electricity access applications where power supply reliability is usually the foremost need.

Abstract: Off-grid renewable energy grids will contribute to the achievement of SDG 7 on universal energy access, especially in off-grid communities. But the scarcity of resources for development aid requires very tight designs that minimize the cost of investment and operation of the mini-grid. To do this, the future energy demand of the community must be analysed very well, which is very difficult due to the lack of previous data. In the literature, two main approaches to analyse future energy demand, deterministic and stochastic methodologies. In this article, we compare both methodologies for a real case study in Honduras and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. Although the deterministic approach requires less information and less mathematical processing, it generates less accurate results. In contrast, the stochastic approach consumes more resources but gives more realistic results for the correct design of the mini-grid. In conclusion, the deterministic approach methods can be useful for the early stages of the project, when the investment is being sized. But for the advanced phases of the project, when the installation is being designed, the stochastic approach is recommended.

Abstract: Aiming at utilizing a large number of distributed energy sources in rural areas such as straw and garbage biomass, rooftop photovoltaics, and decentralized wind power, this study designed a novel structure of a virtual power plant connected with gas-power plant carbon capture (GPPCC), power-to-gas (P2G), and waste incineration power (WI), namely, a GPW-VPP. Then, the information gap decision theory (IGDT) and fuzzy satisfaction method were applied to construct a nearly-zero carbon optimal operation model. In this model, the maximum revenue and minimum carbon emissions were selected as the initial objectives, which were converted into one maximum satisfaction objective. Three uncertainty variables, namely, wind power, photovoltaic power, and user’s load, were described using the IGDT. Secondly, to optimize the distribution of the cooperative operation revenue for the entities in GPW-VPP, a Nash negotiation-based benefit allocation strategy is established considering the multidimensional contribution factors of risks, benefits, and carbon emissions. Finally, the Lankao Rural Energy Revolution Pilot program in China was selected as the case study, the results showed: (1) GPW-VPP can aggregate and utilize different types of distributed energy sources such as rural wind power plants (WPPs) and photovoltaic power generation (PVs) to realize the electricity–carbon–electricity cycle effect. (2) The proposed operation optimization model can measure the uncertainty risk and formulate an optimal plan considering the above dual objectives. When the deviation coefficient of the predicted objectives is 0.5, the uncertainty degree is 0.142, and the cost of the decision plan is less than the expected cost of decision maker. Compared with the maximum revenue objective, the operation revenue and carbon emissions reduced by 4.6% and 35.76% under the comprehensive optimization objective, respectively, (3) The proposed benefit distribution strategy can be used to formulate a better benefit distribution plan that meets the comprehensive contributions of multiple entities. Affected by the risk of output uncertainty, the benefit proportion of WPP and PV increased, but it was 1.64% lower than that in the traditional distribution plan. Affected by carbon emissions, the benefit proportion of biomass power generation decreased, but it was 0.57% higher than that in the traditional distribution plan. Overall, the proposed operation optimization model and benefit distribution strategy can balance the interest requirements of different entities and promote the optimal aggregation and utilization of rural distributed energy resources, which is conducive to the realization of a clean and low-carbon transformation of the overall energy structure.

Abstract: Microgrids are an effective means to provide power to urban and rural communities. Microgrid planning must anticipate both the system's economic feasibility and long-term stability. Due to existing challenging ambitions, limitations, and the uncertainty of renewable energy production, the planning of microgrids is a difficult task. In the present work, a standalone microgrid is planned to integrate solar, wind turbine, diesel generator, and battery for the rural community of the hilly state of Uttarakhand (India). The Feasibility and techno-economic analysis of a proposed microgrid is conducted. The microgrid's performance is investigated using differential evolution and other existing algorithms, particle swarm optimization, and genetic algorithm to ascertain the cheapest option to energize the area. The sizing of components and sensitivity analysis of energy cost with changes in various parameters of the energy system is investigated. The optimization results suggest that the energy cost is $0.16/kWh, with a renewable fraction of 92% and a net present cost of $ 41,078. The obtained results indicated that a renewable-based energy system provides a more effective solution for the electrification of the rural population.
