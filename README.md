Abstract: There are varieties of physical and behavioral factors to determine energy demand load profile. The attainment of the optimum mix of measures and renewable energy system deployment requires a simple method suitable for using at the early design stage. A simple method of formulating load profile (SMLP) for UK domestic buildings has been presented in this paper. Domestic space heating load profile for different types of houses have been produced using thermal dynamic model which has been developed using thermal resistant network method. The daily breakdown energy demand load profile of appliance, domestic hot water and space heating can be predicted using this method. The method can produce daily load profile from individual house to urban community. It is suitable to be used at Renewable energy system strategic design stage.

Abstract: An Integrated Renewable Energy Optimization Model (IREOM) model has been developed for sizing and optimization of renewable energy systems based on seasonal variation in the load profiles of the study area. An attempt has been made to develop correlations between renewable energy system sizes and their capital cost for the user specified system sizes. The developed correlations were used for the analysis of IREOM model using user specified system sizes and compared with manufacturer specified system sizes. The cluster of seven unelectrified villages having micro-hydro power, biomass, wind and solar energy resources in the state of Uttarakhand, India has been considered for the implementation of IREOM model. Based on the results obtained from the proposed model, suitable sizes of renewable energy systems have been suggested.

Abstract: The Binalood region in Iran enjoys an average wind speed of 6.82m/s at 40m elevation and an average daily solar radiation of 4.79kWh/m2/day. Within this perspective, a remote rural village in Binalood region, called Sheikh Abolhassan, can readily be expected to have more than enough potential for its load demand to be supplied with a stand-alone hybrid renewable energy system. Yet the local state-run electrical service provider extended the utility grid to the village in 2006 to boost the already present diesel generator. This study aims, firstly, to explore how economical it would have been to keep supplying the electricity of the village by the diesel generator and add renewable energy generators to increase the renewable fraction of the system. On a second stage, we tried to investigate how renewable energy sources (RESs) can still be added to the current utility grid power supply in Sheikh Abolhassan to achieve a more economical and environmentally friendly system. The software HOMER is used in this study to evaluate the feasibility of various hybrid diesel-RES and grid-RES energy systems. Findings indicated that the addition of renewable power generators to the system both before and after the grid extension could and still can result in a more economical power system, which is obviously cleaner and more climate-benign.

Abstract: Due to the growth of electric end-uses, the management of the variations in time of the electric power demand has become essential, especially in the residential sector. According to this issue, the anticipation of the power demand is of great interest. This implies a better knowledge of the electric load curve of the household stock. Papers about understanding and forecasting energy demand are numerous but studies on building's load curves are rare. In this paper we propose a cross analysis of some existing methods capable of building up a residential electric load curve. Two main types of load curve models have been identified in the literature: top-down and bottom-up methods. Even if the review presents two existing top-down approaches, the authors focused the further analysis on bottom-up models. For each of them we first identify its functional characteristics: finality and scope, input data required, output format, modeled appliances and end-uses covered, generation of the diversity and validation of the model. Secondly, we establish a bloc diagram representing its architecture with focus on the mathematical model chosen. Finally, the authors list the limits of the model in view of the criteria needed to build up an ideal, bottom-up and technically explicit load curve model for the residential sector. A cross reading of the different methodologies is proposed through a global table that characterizes and sums up the analyzed models. Moreover, a graphical representation of the models studied is proposed, according to three criteria (range of application, modelling of the diversity, time scale accuracy) that allows us to compare them “at a glance”. To conclude, an identification of the gaps among existing models is proposed. It consists of listing the end-uses, the appliances and other behavioural correlations which may affect the load curve and that are not included in the reviewed methodologies and need further research.

Abstract: This paper examines the influence of dwelling and occupant characteristics on domestic electricity consumption patterns by analysing data obtained from a smart metering survey of a representative cross section of approximately 4200 domestic Irish dwellings. A multiple linear regression model was applied to four parameters: total electricity consumption, maximum demand, load factor and time of use (ToU) of maximum electricity demand for a number of different dwelling and occupant socio-economic variables. In particular, dwelling type, number of bedrooms, head of household (HoH) age, household composition, social class, water heating and cooking type all had a significant influence over total domestic electricity consumption. Maximum electricity demand was significantly influenced by household composition as well as water heating and cooking type. A strong relationship also existed between maximum demand and most household appliances but, in particular, tumble dryers, dishwashers and electric cookers had the greatest influence over this parameter. Time of use (ToU) for maximum electricity demand was found to be strongly influenced by occupant characteristics, HoH age and household composition. Younger head of households were more inclined to use electricity later in the evening than older occupants. The appliance that showed the greatest potential for shifting demand away from peak time use was the dishwasher.

Abstract: Electricity is an important asset that influences not only the economy, but political or social security of a country. Reliable and accurate planning and prediction of electricity demand for a country are therefore vital. In this paper, electricity demand in Ontario province of Canada from the year 1976–2005 is modeled by using an (adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system) ANFIS. A neuro fuzzy structure can be defined as an ANN (artificial neural network) which is trained by experimental data to find the parameters of (fuzzy inference system) FIS. Inputs for the model include number of employment, (gross domestic product) GDP, population, dwelling count and two meteorological parameters related to annual weather temperature. The data were collected and screened using statistical methods. Then, based on the data, a neuro-fuzzy model for the electricity demand is built. It was found that electricity demand is most sensitive to employment.

Abstract: According to the records of Hong Kong rail operator, MTR Corporation, the weekly electrical consumption of each railway station ranges from 18MWh to 230MWh. Since the electrical consumption of stations is a major factor in the planning of infrastructure, a good prediction of the electrical consumption will greatly assist in the design of the station infrastructure. This study develops an intelligent approach to predict the energy consumption of railway stations. Multi-layered Perceptron (MLP) is adopted to mimic the non-linear correlation between energy consumption, the spatial design of the station, meteorological factors and also the usage of the 19 stations selected. Coefficient of correlation is obtained between the MLP predicted results and the actual collected data to evaluate the performance of the prediction. We apply statistical approach to assess the performance of the developed MLP model. It shows that minimum coefficient of correlation is 0.96 with a 95% confidence level which is considered sufficient for engineering application. This approach is also adopted to predict the profile of the weekly electrical consumption of a selected station. The predicted profile reasonably agrees with that of the actual consumption. This study develops a useful tool to estimate the electrical power consumption of new MTR stations.

Abstract: This paper presents a methodology to size and to optimize a stand-alone hybrid PV/Wind/Diesel/Battery bank minimizing the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCE) and the CO2 emission using a Multi-Objectives Genetic Algorithm approach. The main objective of this work is to study the influence of the load profile variation on the optimal configuration. The methodology developed was applied using solar radiation, temperature and wind speed collected on the site of Gandon located in the northwestern coast of Senegal. Results show that, for the all load profiles, as the LCE increases the CO2 emission decreases. For the all solutions, the LCE was lower for the load profile 3 than for the load profiles 1 and 2.

Abstract: This paper deals with the recent evolution of microgrids being used around the world in real life applications as well as laboratory application for research. This study is intended to introduce the subject by reviewing the components level, structure and types of microgrid applications installed as a plant or modeled as a simulation environment. The paper also presents a survey regarding published papers on why the microgrid is required, and what the components and control systems are which constitute the actual microgrid studies. It leads the researcher to see the microgrid in terms of the actual bigger picture of today and creates a new outlook about the potential developments. Additionally, comparison of microgrids in various regions based on several parameters allows researchers to define the required criteria and features of a special microgrid that is chosen for a particular scenario. The authors of this paper also tabulated all the necessary information about microgrids, and proposed a standard microgrid for better power quality and optimizing energy generation. Consequently, it is focused on inadequate knowledge and technology gaps in the power system field with regards to the future, and it is this which has been illustrated for the reader. The existing microgrid testbeds all around the world have been studied and analyzed and several of them are explained as an example in this study. Later, those investigated distribution systems are classified based on region (North America, Europe and Asia) and, as presented in literature, a significant amount of deviation has been found. Several tabulated data sheets have been used to compare and contrast the existing test systems. This research has been concluded with worthy findings and potential areas of research that would enhance the current distributed network as well as introduce microgrid testbeds comprehensively, and aid designers in optimizing green distributed system efficiency for a reliable power supply.

Abstract: In this work we present a detailed description of a 7.2kWp photovoltaic power plant installed in the remote rural village Elkaria (province of Essaouira in Morocco). This plant supplies 16 households with electricity through a local grid that was installed for this purpose. The results of monitoring some performance parameters of the plant such as load curve, the yields and the performance ratio are presented and discussed. The performance ratio of the PV plant varied between 33% and 70.2%. The low values of this parameter are mainly attributed to the way the battery inverter manages the energy flow.

Abstract: Renewable energy-based off-grid or decentralised electricity supply has traditionally considered a single technology-based limited level of supply to meet the basic needs, without considering reliable energy provision to rural consumers. The purpose of this paper is to propose the best hybrid technology combination for electricity generation from a mix of renewable energy resources to satisfy the electrical needs in a reliable manner of an off-grid remote village, Palari in the state of Chhattisgarh, India. Four renewable resources, namely, small-scale hydropower, solar photovoltaic systems, wind turbines and bio-diesel generators are considered. The paper estimates the residential, institutional, commercial, agricultural and small-scale industrial demand in the pre-HOMER analysis. Using HOMER, the paper identifies the optimal off-grid option and compares this with conventional grid extension. The solution obtained shows that a hybrid combination of renewable energy generators at an off-grid location can be a cost-effective alternative to grid extension and it is sustainable, techno-economically viable and environmentally sound. The paper also presents a post-HOMER analysis and discusses issues that are likely to affect/influence the realisation of the optimal solution.

Abstract: The potential for small self-contained grid systems to provide electricity for currently unserved regions of the developing world is widely recognised. However planning and managing the electrical demand that will be supported, so that a mini-grid system is not overloaded and its available resource is used as fully as possible, is actually more difficult than for a large scale grid system. This paper discusses the mathematical reasons why this is the case, and describes a practical software tool for mini-grid demand estimation and planning that is complementary to the widely used HOMER software. This software tool is made available for download on an open source basis. Finally a conclusion is offered that mini-grid systems should aim to serve at least 50 households so that demand variability is more manageable and economies of scale can be realised.

Abstract: Access to electricity is widely recognized as an important factor for economic and social development. Low rates of access, particularly in remote rural areas in regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia, have led developing nations and international organizations to set ambitious goals to expand the reach of electricity. Decentralized solutions such as microgrids have been proposed as cost effective solutions to reaching communities located far from central grid infrastructure. Lack of capital from public and donor sources has severely impeded achieving access goals, leading to calls for greater private sector participation in electrification activities. However, due to the high level of risk associated with decentralized electrification projects in low-income areas, marginal expected returns on investment, and a lack of clear and effective public policy, the private sector has not shown significant interest in participating in such projects. The purpose of this paper is to review barriers to private sector participation in decentralized electrification projects and to identify solutions that have been implemented and proposed to overcome these barriers. The barriers discussed include unsecure revenue streams, inability to finance projects, and long-term project risks such as grid encroachment. The range of interventions and business models reviewed include methods to secure reliable demand, subsidy models, risk guarantees, and different revenue models. This paper does not include an analysis of the effectiveness of the different interventions described. Future research should evaluate the relative costs and benefits of these interventions in order to provide robust policy guidance to decision makers in developing countries.

Abstract: Rural electrification improves the quality of life of rural dwellers having limited or non-access to electricity through decentralized electricity coverage. Since the price of oil is unstable and fluctuating day by day and grid expansion is not also a cost effective solution, integrating renewable energy sources thus become an important alternative for rural electrification. The present study investigated the feasibility of different power generation configurations comprising solar array, wind turbine and diesel generator in different locations within the geo-political zones of Nigeria. Six rural communities were randomly chosen from each of the six geo-political zones in Nigeria with the intention that the results of the study could be replicated in other remote locations of the selected zones with similar terrains. HOMER (Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewable) simulation software was used to determine the economic feasibility of the systems. The simulations concentrated on the net present costs, cost of energy and renewable fraction of the given hybrid configurations for all the climatic zones. The analysis indicates that the PV/diesel/battery hybrid renewable system configuration is found as optimum architecture for both sensitivity cases of 1.1 and $1.3/l of diesel. It also displayed better performance in fuel consumption and CO2 reduction.

Abstract: The present study uses the DHW (domestic hot water) electric backup from solar thermal systems to optimize the total electricity dispatch of an isolated mini-grid. The proposed approach estimates the hourly DHW load, and proposes and simulates different DR (demand response) strategies, from the supply side, to minimize the dispatch costs of an energy system. The case study consists on optimizing the electricity load, in a representative day with low solar radiation, in Corvo Island, Azores. The DHW backup is induced by three different demand patterns. The study compares different DR strategies: backup at demand (no strategy), pre-scheduled backup using two different imposed schedules, a strategy based on linear programming, and finally two strategies using genetic algorithms, with different formulations for DHW backup – one that assigns number of systems and another that assigns energy demand. It is concluded that pre-determined DR strategies may increase the generation costs, but DR strategies based on optimization algorithms are able to decrease generation costs. In particular, linear programming is the strategy that presents the lowest increase on dispatch costs, but the strategy based on genetic algorithms is the one that best minimizes both daily operation costs and total energy demand, of the system.

Abstract: In recent years, renewable energy can be seen as one of the important prospect of today's research, as it is likely to enlighten the lives of millions of people by fulfilling demand of electricity in their daily life. The present work focuses on the development of optimal hybrid energy system sizing model based on comparative analysis of particle swarm optimization, genetic algorithm and Homer software for energy index ratio of 1. The model also incorporates renewable fraction, emissions of carbon di oxide from diesel generator, net present cost and cost of energy. The system is developed to supply the demand of 7 un-electrified villages of Dhauladevi block of Almora district in Uttarakhand, India with the help of the available resources of solar, hydro, biomass and biogas energy along with the addition of diesel generator, for meeting out the energy deficit. From the optimization results, minimum cost of energy and maximum renewable fraction are obtained as 5.77 Rs/kWh and 92.6% respectively.

Abstract: We introduce an integrated model for characterization of spatiotemporal building energy consumption patterns in neighborhoods and city districts. The model addresses the need for a comprehensive method to identify present and potential states of building energy consumption in the context of urban transformation. The focus lies on determining the spatiotemporal variability of energy services in both standing and future buildings in the residential, commercial and industrial sectors. This detailed characterization facilitates the assessment of potential energy efficiency measures at the neighborhood and city district scales. In a novel approach we integrated existing methods in urban and energy planning domains such as spatial analysis, dynamic building energy modeling and energy mapping to provide a comprehensive, multi-scale and multi-dimensional model of analysis. The model is part of a geographic information system (GIS), which serves as a platform for the allocation and future dissemination of spatiotemporal data. The model is validated against measured data and a peer model for a city district in Switzerland. In this context, we present practical applications in the analysis of energy efficiency measures in buildings and urban zoning. We furthermore discuss potential applications in educational, urban and energy planning practices.

Abstract: The sizing of a stand-alone wind-photovoltaic-battery hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) is greatly influenced by socio-demographic factors however, few studies have examined how socio-demographic factors, as borne out by different electrical usage patterns, influence the size of HRESs. This paper investigates how these factors influence the optimal sizing of a stand-alone HRES using a hybrid optimization method to match the available renewable energy with the demand. In this regard, different energy usage patterns resulting from users socio-demographic profile have been investigated and used for the optimal sizing of a HRES. The results show that the electricity usage profile of a site has a significant impact on the sizing and design of the system. Further, the results illustrate that one can design a system that meets the demand profiles resulting from socio-demographic factors with a minimum unmet load; however, by optimizing systems to the users socio-demographic profile, significant cost savings can be made.

Abstract: A large number of populations of the world; especially in developing countries; are living in rural or remote areas those are geographically isolated from the grid connection. Power supply and uninterrupted fuel transportation to produce electrical power for these areas poses a great challenge. Using renewable energy in off grid hybrid energy system might be a pathway to solve this problem. Malaysia is a hilly land with the gift of renewable energy resources. There is a possibility to utilize these renewable resources to produce electrical power and to limit the dependency on the fossil fuel. In this perspective, a research is carried out to analyze the performance of an off-grid PV (photovoltaic)-wind-diesel-battery hybrid energy system for a remote area named “KLIA Sepang Station” located in the state of Selangor, Malaysia. The system is designed as well as simulated to support a small community considering an average load demand of 33 kWh/day with a peak load of 3.9 kW. The simulation and optimization of operations of the system have been done by HOMER (Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewable) software using the real time field data of solar radiation and wind speed of that area. The simulation ensures that the system is suitably feasible with respect to net present cost (NPC) and CO2 emission reduction purpose. The result shows that NPC and CO2 emission can be reduced about 29.65% and 16 tons per year respectively compared to the conventional power plants. The NPC of the optimized system has been found about USD 288,194.00 having the per unit Cost of Energy (COE) about USD 1.877/kWh. The analyzed hybrid energy system might be applicable for other region of the world where the climate conditions are similar.

Abstract: In this paper, we describe the development, implementation and application of a novel mathematical procedure devoted to formulating the daily load profiles of off-grid consumers in rural areas. The procedure aims at providing such profiles as input data for the design process of off-grid systems for rural electrification. Indeed, daily load profiles represent an essential input for off-grid systems capacity planning methods based on steady-state energy simulation and lifetime techno-economic analyses, and for the analysis of the logics to control the energy fluxes among the different system components. Nevertheless, no particular attention has been devoted so far in the scientific literature as regards specific approaches for daily load profiles estimates for rural consumers. In order to contribute to covering this gap, we developed a new mathematical procedure taking into consideration the specific features of rural areas. The procedure is based on a set of data that can be surveyed and/or assumed in rural areas, and it relies on a stochastic bottom-up approach with correlations between the different load profile parameters (i.e. load factor, coincidence factor and number of consumers) in order to build up the coincidence behavior of the electrical appliances. We have implemented the procedure in a software tool (LoadProGen) which can eventually support the off-grid systems design process for rural electrification. Finally, we have applied the procedure to a case study in order to clarify the proposed approach.

Abstract: Due to an expanding integration of renewable energy resources in the power systems, mismatches between electricity supply and demand will increase. A promising solution to deal with these issues is Demand Response (DR), which incentives end-users to be flexible in their electricity consumption. This paper presents a bottom up simulation model that generates office building electricity load profiles representative for Northern Europe. The model connects behavioral aspects of office workers with electricity usage from appliances, and physical representation of the building to describe the energy use of the Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning systems. To validate the model, simulations are performed with respect to two data sets, and compared with real load measurements. The validation shows that the model can reproduce load profiles with reasonable accuracy for both data sets. With the presented model approach, it is possible to define simple portfolio office building models which subsequently can be used for simulation and analysis of DR in the power systems.

Abstract: Due to the depletion of fossil fuel reserves, it is feared that the world will run out of its energy resources soon. Besides, unpredictable fluctuation of diesel prices in electricity generation is affecting the economy of a country. Thus, for developing country that's economically leans on the use of energy, renewable energy resources should be utilized to meet the increasing energy demand. In this regards, the cogeneration system using renewable energy sources is appropriate, because it has the advantage of producing both electrical power and heat energy from a single fuel. It is suitable for commercial clients like hospital buildings which requires to supply both electric and heat load. Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess the viability to develop a cogeneration system for a hospital building load in Malaysia. The proposed cogeneration system consists of grid connected photovoltaic (PV), fuel cell, and battery. Hybrid optimization model for electric renewable (HOMER) simulation software is used to perform the techno-economic analysis of the proposed system. The proposed system is then compared with other possible configurations. The economical comparison is based on the total net present cost (TNPC), levelized cost of energy (LCOE), renewable fraction, excess energy production and the pollutant gas emission of the system. The simulation result shows that, the proposed cogeneration system has the lowest TNPC, LCOE and operating cost which are $ 106,551, 0.091 $/kWh and 7245 $/yr respectively. Besides, the proposed cogeneration system is proven environmentally friendly as it only produces total 25,873 kg/yr of pollutant gas. The sensitivity analysis where fuel prices and annual interest rate are considered as sensitive parameters, shows impact on the TNPC and LCOE. Finally, the benefit from the Feed in Tariff (FiT) program provided by the government also has been presented.

Abstract: Mini-grids for rural electrification in developing countries are growing in popularity but are not yet widely deployed. A key barrier of mini-grid proliferation is the uncertainty in predicting customer electricity consumption, which adds financial risk. Energy-use surveys deployed in the pre-feasibility stage that capture present and aspirational consumption are intended to reduce this uncertainty. However, the general reliability and accuracy of these surveys has not been demonstrated. This research compares survey-predicted electrical energy use to actual measured consumption of customers of eight mini-grids in rural Kenya. A follow-up audit compares the aspirational inventory of appliances to the realized inventory. The analysis shows that the ability to accurately estimate past consumption based on survey or audit data, even in a relatively short time-horizon is prone to appreciable error — a mean absolute error of 426Wh/day per customer on a mean consumption of 113Wh/day per customer. An alternative data-driven proxy village approach, which uses average customer consumption from each mini-grid to predict consumption at other mini-grids, was more accurate and reduced the mean absolute error to 75Wh/day per customer. Hourly load profiles were constructed to provide insight into potential causes of error and to suggest how the data provided in this work can be used in computer-aided mini-grid design programs.

Abstract: The assessment of off-grid electrification programs in developing countries largely based on mini-grid and solar home system (SHS) has shown that they are faced with low development imparts and sustainability challenges, which has resulted in failure of many projects. This study provides solutions on how to surmount these challenges, leaning on the experience of a hybrid solar-diesel mini-grid at Tsumkwe village in Namibia. It provides analyses of a case study based on empirical evidence from field studies, interviews of representatives of households, public institutions and energy providers. In addition, it investigates the technical challenges and economic impacts of the electrification program. HOMER™ and MATLAB™ models were used in the analysis and investigations. The findings show that despite the challenges, the system has been sustained because it keyed into an existing structure with growth potentials. The progressive tariff system adopted by the government helped to cushion costs and allow low income households in the energy matrix. Adoption of strict maintenance measures, and implementation of energy efficiency measures prior to the commissioning of the program, resulted in the reduction of costs. The success elements identified in this study could be extrapolated in other sub-Saharan African countries if the challenges are properly addressed.

Abstract: A microgrid system, be it connected to the utility grid or an independent system, usually consists of a mix of generation - renewable and non-renewable; loads - controllable or non-controllable and Energy Storage Systems (ESSs) such as batteries or flywheels. In order to determine how much power is utilized from the controllable resources such as ESS, diesel generators, micro-turbines or gas turbines, we first need to determine how much the demand is or how much the renewable energy sources are generating is which is accomplished using forecasting techniques. Due to the intermittent nature of renewable resources such as wind energy or solar energy, it is difficult to forecast wind power or solar power accurately. These forecasts are highly dependent on weather forecasts. It is evident that forecast of any data based on forecast of other parameters would lead to further inaccuracy, even if the relation between the inputs and output maybe predetermined through regression methods. Therefore, this paper illustrates an approach to use historical power data instead of numerical weather predictions to produce short-term forecast results. The concept is based on persistence method presented in [1]. This method uses the “today equals tomorrow” concept. From [2], we know that persistence technique produces results that are more accurate as compared to other forecasting techniques for a look-ahead time of 4-6 hours. Both [1] and [2] were based on wind power forecasting. In this paper, we investigate persistence method for short-term electrical demand, solar PV (Photovoltaic) power and wind power forecasting. Since the forecasts are dependent on historical averages of the data in the ‘near’ past, the accuracy is inversely proportional to the variation of power between the historical data and the actual data.

Abstract: Indian power supply is dominated by large coal based power plants connected to the national grid. Though it is economically viable for large consumption in industries but it may not be sustainable for many poor Indian villages, specifically for remote off-grid connection. Decentralized small scale power or even multi utility systems using local resources may be a sustainable option for these villages. Multi-utility energy system, i.e. polygeneration helps to cater to the secondary energy needs of a locality. But the secondary energy supply should be available at affordable cost. Minimization of the cost of secondary energy helps to increase the economic acceptability of a distributed energy system. In this paper, a polygeneration with solar PV, biomass power, ethanol production unit and cooling is proposed for an Indian off grid village. An economic model developed in MATLAB using linear programming approach to determine the optimal size of the system by maximization of the annualized profit has been reported. Results show that multiple energy utility supply is possible through distributed polygeneration. This renewable energy based polygeneration reduce CO2 emission significantly as compared to diesel generator set. Reliability and sensitivity analysis as well as comparison of estimated performance for four different locations in India is reported.

Abstract: Mini-grids are seen as an important option for increasing access to electricity in non-electrified rural areas where grid-extension is unfeasible. Appropriately dimensioning and constructing mini-grids requires knowledge of electricity usage. There is currently a lack of measured load profiles from mini-grids and the most common method for estimating electricity usage is through appliance data collected via interviews. Thus, this paper compares and investigates the differences between measured daily load profiles and daily load profiles created from appliance data collected through interviews and how the two methods impact the dimensioning and operation of a mini-grid. This is done by comparing load profiles for an entire mini-grid, a household and SME customers with large loads. The paper reports differing results from the two methodologies. Generally, the results show that the interview-based load profiles fail to provide an accurate overall estimate. The calculated performance metrics for the two methods also shows large differences. The interview-based load profiles mainly fail to provide accurate estimates of energy and the energy related (capacity factor and load factor) performance metrics. Accordingly, the implications for mini-grid operators and developers could be significant. The interview-based load profiles indicate the mini-grid system to be considerably less technically and economically desirable than measurements show. Suggestions for how the interview process can be improved are presented.

Abstract: PV and wind hybrid are found to be the most lucrative solution for the diminishing traditional energy sources. Whereas these alternatives sources of the energy have many remarkable rewards like cost of energy and feasibility etc. The attributes of these sources of being cost effective and stable are possible due to their complementary nature as compared to independent energy systems. Therefore, these systems have admirable capability to meet energy crisis up to some extent. The proposed work gives the idea about various configuration, control strategy, techno-economic analysis and social effect. The findings of comprehensive review will help for further improvements in hybrid system design and control with respect to practical system implementation. This paper also presents a case study of remote area Barwani, India and results are compared using Homer and PSO. The resulting analysis reveals that configurations of hybrid system are the most techno-economical feasible solution concerning COE, renewable fraction, maximum renewable penetration, levelized cost, operating cost, mean electrical efficiency, and emission amongst various hybrid system configurations using PSO as compared to HOMER.

Abstract: The relationship among occupants’ presence, activities and appliance use is essential for households’ energy use. In the present work, we aimed to link occupants’ energy-related activities to electricity demand, in order to obtain a representative daily electricity load profile for Danish households using Danish time-use survey (DTUS) data. The approach was to combine appliance ownership and power ratings with occupant activities from the DTUS. Two modelling approaches were implemented: in the first approach, the occupant activities profiles from the DTUS were used directly to determine activities at 10-minute intervals. In the second approach, the probabilities of starting time and duration of the occupant activities were used to determine activities. In both approaches, appliance use was assigned to the energy-related activities. The set of appliances used in each activity was determined from a national database of appliance ownership, and the appliances’ power was calibrated using information from apartments in Copenhagen, Denmark. The modelled daily electricity load profile was compared with three measured datasets of varying sizes and from different parts of Denmark. Both approaches captured important qualitative characteristics of the measured load profiles. However, the first approach used a more simple method and resulted in smaller errors than the second approach.

Abstract: Energy access projects in remote off-grid areas would benefit from the adoption of a multi-energy system perspective, addressing all energy needs – not only lighting and power appliances, but also water-heating and cooking – by means of a mix of energy vectors. However, multi-energy analyses in remote areas are hindered by a lack of models allowing for the generation of multi-energy load profiles based on interview-based information characterised by high uncertainty. This study proposes a novel open-source bottom-up stochastic model specifically conceived for the generation of multi-energy loads for systems located in remote areas. The model is tested and validated against data obtained from a real system, showing a very good approximation of measured profiles, with percentage errors consistently below 2% for all the selected indicators, and an improved accuracy compared to existing approaches. In particular, some innovative features – such as the possibility to define and modulate throughout the day appliances’ duty cycles – seem to be determinant in marking a difference with previous approaches. This might arguably be even more beneficial for case studies characterised by a larger penetration of appliances that are subject to complex and unpredictable duty cycle behaviour.

Abstract: Efforts towards ensuring clean and affordable electricity for all have been progressing slowly in rural, off grid areas of developing countries. In this context, hybrid microgrids may offer reliable and potentially clean electricity for isolated locations. Nevertheless, the process of planning and operation of these systems faces several challenges, often due to the uncertainties related to the renewable resources and to the stochastic nature of electricity consumption in rural contexts. This paper tackles this problem and contributes to the literature in bridging the gap between field practices and two-stage stochastic modeling approaches by identifying an open-source modeling framework which is then applied to real local data. As reference case-study, we consider a microgrid built in 2015 in Bolivia. Overall, the optimal system results from a compromise between the Net Present Cost, the peak capacity installed and the flexibility (to balance variable generation). Different approaches to size isolated microgrids are tested, with the conclusion that methods accounting for the uncertainty in both demand and renewable generation may lead to a more robust configuration with little impacts on the final cost for the community.

Abstract: Having continuous load structure and composition information of substations has a great relevance in power system analysis such as load modeling, load forecasting and demand-side management. In this paper, a parsimonious approach for load composition estimation using non-intrusive load disaggregation techniques for low voltage substations is presented with a concept of using ZIP load model characteristics of the aggregate active and reactive powers as predictor features. The disaggregation system uses machine learning algorithms such as Function Fitting Multi-Layer Perceptron Artificial Neural Network (MLP-ANN), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). During the study, a simulation dataset was generated using Monte Carlo simulation. Moreover, a comparative analysis with a benchmarked paper has been assessed and the proposed approach significantly outperforms.

Abstract: Electric power systems are undergoing significant changes in all sectors at all voltage levels. The growing penetration of Renewable Energy Resources (RES), the liberalization of energy markets, the spread of active customers, the increasing diffusion of green energy policies to foster sustainable and low-emission policies, represent the main drivers in the evolution of the electric system. For these reasons, Distribution System Operators (DSO) are asked to adopt modern Distribution Management Systems (DMS) in order to manage RES uncertainties for an efficient, flexible and economic operation of distribution systems. In this context, the paper presents the design and the implementation in a real DMS of two advanced functionalities: load forecasting and load modeling. These two algorithms are based on an ensemble of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The good performances obtained on a real distribution network encourage the exploitation of the two proposed techniques to deal with demand uncertainties, in order to use efficiently the controllable resources and to face the stochastic behavior of RES.

Abstract: Building electrical load profiles can improve understanding of building energy efficiency, demand flexibility, and building-grid interactions. Current approaches to generating load profiles are time-consuming and not capable of reflecting the dynamic and stochastic behaviors of real buildings; some approaches also trigger data privacy concerns. In this study, we proposed a novel approach for generating realistic electrical load profiles of buildings through the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), a machine learning technique that is capable of revealing an unknown probability distribution purely from data. The proposed approach has three main steps: (1) normalizing the daily 24-hour load profiles, (2) clustering the daily load profiles with the k-means algorithm, and (3) using GAN to generate daily load profiles for each cluster. The approach was tested with an open-source database – the Building Data Genome Project. We validated the proposed method by comparing the mean, standard deviation, and distribution of key parameters of the generated load profiles with those of the real ones. The KL divergence of the generated and real load profiles are within 0.3 for majority of parameters and clusters. Additionally, results showed the load profiles generated by GAN can capture not only the general trend but also the random variations of the actual electrical loads in buildings. The proposed GAN approach can be used to generate building electrical load profiles, verify other load profile generation models, detect changes to load profiles, and more importantly, anonymize smart meter data for sharing, to support research and applications of grid-interactive efficient buildings.

Abstract: Small-scale off-grid renewable energy systems are being increasingly used for rural electrification, commonly as stand-alone home systems or community micro-grids. With the variety of technologies and configurations available, it is not clear which options are sustainable for remote communities. This study investigates the life cycle environmental sustainability of both home and community installations, designed as part of this work, which utilise diesel, solar, and wind resources coupled with battery storage. A total of 21 system configurations (six home systems and 15 micro-grids) have been designed and optimised for a prototypical rural community in the Philippines, considering both stand-alone and hybrid systems. Life cycle assessment (LCA) considering 18 potential impact categories has been carried out to compare the environmental impacts associated with electricity production of each option. At the household level, hybrid solar photovoltaics (PV)-wind systems with storage have 17–40% lower impacts than the equivalent stand-alone installations per kWh generated. Batteries are a major environmental hotspot, causing up to 88% of the life cycle impacts of a home energy system. Among the community micro-grid options, the PV-wind-lead acid battery hybrid system has the lowest impacts in many categories, including climate change, ozone depletion, and acidification. Comparing equivalent architectures for single-household and community-scale installations, PV systems are environmentally more sustainable if installed individually in households, while larger turbines in community micro-grids are environmentally better for wind utilisation. The results suggest that a household-scale PV system integrated within a micro-grid with community-scale wind turbines and Li-ion batteries is environmentally the most sustainable configuration.

Abstract: Building consumption data is integral to numerous applications including retrofit analysis, Smart Grid integration and optimization, and load forecasting. Still, due to technical limitations, privacy concerns and the proprietary nature of the industry, usable data is often unavailable for research and development. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) - which generate synthetic instances that resemble those from an original training dataset - have been proposed to help address this issue. Previous studies use GANs to generate building sequence data, but the models are not typically designed for time series problems, they often require relatively large amounts of input data (at least 20,000 sequences) and it is unclear whether they correctly capture the temporal behaviour of the buildings. In this work we implement a conditional temporal GAN that addresses these issues, and we show that it exhibits state-of-the-art performance on small datasets. 22 different experiments that vary according to their data inputs are benchmarked using Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) and predictive forecasting validation error. Of these, the best performing is also evaluated using a curated set of metrics that extends those of previous work to include PCA, deep-learning based forecasting and measurements of trend and seasonality. Two case studies are included: one for residential and one for commercial buildings. The model achieves a JSD of 0.012 on the former data and 0.037 on the latter, using only 396 and 156 original load sequences, respectively.

Abstract: With the vast rural population, the availability of locational renewable energy resources and limited finances in low-income (developing) countries, there is the need for an integrated and holistic energy planning framework to unlock their potential for achieving energy-based economic development. The integrated rural energy planning framework provides a unified road map for energy planning and system design with renewable energy integration geared towards improving energy access in rural areas. Therefore, this study presents the application of case studies to this framework to foster improved localized renewable energy access in low-income (developing) countries. Using rural Nigeria as the geographic scope, the site identification and selection and the locational estimation of annual energy demand steps of the framework are performed for rural areas. Utilizing GIS-based tools, rural communities are identified, and their viable renewable energy resources are estimated. Adopting the reference building approach, seasonal disaggregated energy demand profiles are obtained at community scale with an hourly time-step. These are obtained in the absence of smart-metering equipment and measured datasets on energy use. The obtained results provide insights to inform localized energy policy design by combining rural electrification with energy conservation strategies. This framework has wide applicability across areas with similar energy access and rural development issues especially in sub-Saharan Africa and developing Asia.

Abstract: Electricity access in developing countries, where the availability of public distribution grids is still poor, is considered a key factor for improvement of people life conditions. In these situations, the lack of a reliable grid can be mitigated by the introduction of stand-alone DC microgrids, including small Photovoltaic (PV) generators and storage devices. This paper focuses on optimal energy management and power supply reliability of such a microgrid. In particular, a Model-Predictive-Control (MPC) - based control system is introduced to optimally manage storage devices and coordinate load shedding actions. Additionally, an Artificial-Neural-Network (ANN) - based predictor is introduced to manage unpredictable solar irradiance and temperature variations. The availability of reliable adaptive forecasts provided by the ANN-based predictor increases the efficiency of the optimization performed by the MPC-based control over the prediction horizon, avoiding the well-known issues related to optimization performed on unreliable forecast. In this paper, the proposed control approach is detailed for a specific case study and its advantages with respect to traditional controller algorithms are highlighted by comprehensive numerical simulations. The presented results highlight that the proposed MPC controller provides a substantial increment in power supply reliability with respect to standard controls, especially for priority loads. This is obtained at the expense of an increased battery stress, which is acceptable for electricity access applications where power supply reliability is usually the foremost need.

Abstract: Off-grid renewable energy grids will contribute to the achievement of SDG 7 on universal energy access, especially in off-grid communities. But the scarcity of resources for development aid requires very tight designs that minimize the cost of investment and operation of the mini-grid. To do this, the future energy demand of the community must be analysed very well, which is very difficult due to the lack of previous data. In the literature, two main approaches to analyse future energy demand, deterministic and stochastic methodologies. In this article, we compare both methodologies for a real case study in Honduras and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. Although the deterministic approach requires less information and less mathematical processing, it generates less accurate results. In contrast, the stochastic approach consumes more resources but gives more realistic results for the correct design of the mini-grid. In conclusion, the deterministic approach methods can be useful for the early stages of the project, when the investment is being sized. But for the advanced phases of the project, when the installation is being designed, the stochastic approach is recommended.

Abstract: Aiming at utilizing a large number of distributed energy sources in rural areas such as straw and garbage biomass, rooftop photovoltaics, and decentralized wind power, this study designed a novel structure of a virtual power plant connected with gas-power plant carbon capture (GPPCC), power-to-gas (P2G), and waste incineration power (WI), namely, a GPW-VPP. Then, the information gap decision theory (IGDT) and fuzzy satisfaction method were applied to construct a nearly-zero carbon optimal operation model. In this model, the maximum revenue and minimum carbon emissions were selected as the initial objectives, which were converted into one maximum satisfaction objective. Three uncertainty variables, namely, wind power, photovoltaic power, and user’s load, were described using the IGDT. Secondly, to optimize the distribution of the cooperative operation revenue for the entities in GPW-VPP, a Nash negotiation-based benefit allocation strategy is established considering the multidimensional contribution factors of risks, benefits, and carbon emissions. Finally, the Lankao Rural Energy Revolution Pilot program in China was selected as the case study, the results showed: (1) GPW-VPP can aggregate and utilize different types of distributed energy sources such as rural wind power plants (WPPs) and photovoltaic power generation (PVs) to realize the electricity–carbon–electricity cycle effect. (2) The proposed operation optimization model can measure the uncertainty risk and formulate an optimal plan considering the above dual objectives. When the deviation coefficient of the predicted objectives is 0.5, the uncertainty degree is 0.142, and the cost of the decision plan is less than the expected cost of decision maker. Compared with the maximum revenue objective, the operation revenue and carbon emissions reduced by 4.6% and 35.76% under the comprehensive optimization objective, respectively, (3) The proposed benefit distribution strategy can be used to formulate a better benefit distribution plan that meets the comprehensive contributions of multiple entities. Affected by the risk of output uncertainty, the benefit proportion of WPP and PV increased, but it was 1.64% lower than that in the traditional distribution plan. Affected by carbon emissions, the benefit proportion of biomass power generation decreased, but it was 0.57% higher than that in the traditional distribution plan. Overall, the proposed operation optimization model and benefit distribution strategy can balance the interest requirements of different entities and promote the optimal aggregation and utilization of rural distributed energy resources, which is conducive to the realization of a clean and low-carbon transformation of the overall energy structure.

Abstract: Microgrids are an effective means to provide power to urban and rural communities. Microgrid planning must anticipate both the system's economic feasibility and long-term stability. Due to existing challenging ambitions, limitations, and the uncertainty of renewable energy production, the planning of microgrids is a difficult task. In the present work, a standalone microgrid is planned to integrate solar, wind turbine, diesel generator, and battery for the rural community of the hilly state of Uttarakhand (India). The Feasibility and techno-economic analysis of a proposed microgrid is conducted. The microgrid's performance is investigated using differential evolution and other existing algorithms, particle swarm optimization, and genetic algorithm to ascertain the cheapest option to energize the area. The sizing of components and sensitivity analysis of energy cost with changes in various parameters of the energy system is investigated. The optimization results suggest that the energy cost is $0.16/kWh, with a renewable fraction of 92% and a net present cost of $ 41,078. The obtained results indicated that a renewable-based energy system provides a more effective solution for the electrification of the rural population.

Abstract: Access to clean energy for communities living in remote areas where grid extension is considered unfeasible can be provided by off-grid electrification systems using renewable energy (RE). Especially in developing countries, ensuring the appropriateness of such systems is crucial because it will determine the system's sustainability despite its limited resources. This study demonstrates the design process of an appropriate system by assessing the potential of three RE sources: solar, wind, and biomass in an oil palm and rubber-tree plantation village in South Kalimantan Province, Indonesia. A social assessment is done to avoid sustainability issues of the previously introduced technology intervention by identifying correlations between residents' attributes and satisfaction levels on a selection of social values through multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) and nonparametric methods. The techno-economic assessment and sensitivity analysis uses local data processed with the Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Energy Resources (HOMER) software. Results identified the need for a more appropriate clean energy supply for cooking, the potential role of modern technology, and access to information and communication in income generation, among other needs and opportunities that can be linked with the energy system design. The technical assessment showed that a centralized solar power plant paired with a diesel engine could provide power to the village. However, the cost of electricity (COE) is much higher than the price cap introduced by the national electricity company. This study urges a clear mechanism and a guarantee for the delivery of feed-in-tariffs (FIT) and a price cap exemption for off-grid RE systems. Furthermore, a people-centered public–private partnership business model and a remote capacity-building intervention are also needed. An appropriate energy system design must be supported by an enabling environment and supporting policies to be feasible.

Abstract: Planners at utilities want automated and accurate load forecasts for short-, medium- and long-term load planning. Accurate forecasts are crucial to meet future load demand in response to national growth and to use as a baseline for tariff discussions. Here we propose an end-to-end approach for the data model, forecast model, and forecasting and demand reporting methods. Such an approach can help plan distribution across various geographic areas, such as urban areas, development areas, remote villages/villages, agricultural land, and farms. Such a solution and approach would also look at a top-down forecasting model to consider the electricity consumption pattern relative to macroeconomic factors and weather-related parameters and then disaggregate it while considering distribution losses and other parameters. This model also addresses the rebalancing of peak demand within a feeder. Optimization techniques can create a group of feeders for optimal demand management without needing a new feeder or substation. This study can be used for multiple purposes, and this system can provide a higher degree of predictability and productivity to identify gaps and accelerate reconciliation. Automated and peak load prediction solutions based on data and artificial intelligence can help create a variety of energy demand scenarios for annual peak load and energy requirements. Accurate load prediction can reduce the cost of holding capacity and reliably avoid power and related outages. Automating the forecasting process can help achieve consistent forecasting, supplement field knowledge, and reduce manual errors, leading to timely, high-level forecasts and efficient use of human resources.
